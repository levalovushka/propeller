and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [2.14.0] - 2026-07-22

### Added

- **Opus file support for file transcription.** `/v1/transcribe` and
  `gigastt transcribe` now accept OGG/Opus and `.opus` files — Telegram voice
  notes, browser MediaRecorder captures, and `opusenc` output. Symphonia
  demuxes the OGG container but ships no Opus decoder, so packets are decoded
  by the pure-Rust BSD-3-Clause `opus-rs` crate (a libopus port; decoder
  only) in the same fallback architecture as the telephony codecs, then
  resampled from the native 48 kHz to the model's 16 kHz. Mono and stereo
  (mixed to mono) are supported; multistream (>2 channel) OGG/Opus is
  rejected. Decoder output is verified against an independent ffmpeg/libopus
  reference decode.
- **macOS support in the Swift package.** `GigasttFFI.xcframework` now ships a
  macOS arm64 slice alongside the iOS ones (ONNX Runtime statically linked into
  the slice, no separate runtime to bundle), and the package declares
  `.macOS(.v13)` next to `.iOS(.v15)` — macOS apps can embed GigaSTT directly
  instead of shipping the CLI as a sidecar. The release workflow smoke-tests
  the macOS slice before publishing. The xcframework zip grows by ~30 MB.
- **Batch and watch-folder CLI: `gigastt transcribe-batch` and `gigastt watch`.**
  First-class folder transcription without shell wrappers: `transcribe-batch
  <in> <out>` recursively transcribes every WAV / MP3 / M4A / OGG / FLAC file
  under a directory, writing `<stem>.txt` + `<stem>.json` (configurable via
  `--format txt,json,md,srt,vtt`) per file with `--pool-size` parallel workers;
  `watch <in> <out>` polls a folder and transcribes new or changed files once
  their size+mtime stays stable across `--settle-polls` polls, so
  partially-copied files are never picked up. Both support `--move-to done/` /
  `--delete-source` post-success source policies, per-file retries, and
  graceful Ctrl-C (in-flight files finish; `transcribe-batch` exits 130 like
  `download`). Files already present when `watch` starts are left for
  `transcribe-batch`. See [docs/cli.md](docs/cli.md).
- **Telephony codecs for file transcription.** `/v1/transcribe` now accepts the
  typical PBX/VoIP outputs end to end:
  - G.711 A-law / μ-law in WAV — already decoded via symphonia, now pinned by
    unit + e2e tests and documented.
  - G.722 ADPCM in WAV (format tags `0x0064` and `0x028F` — Asterisk / Cisco /
    Teams-player exports), decoded via the MIT-licensed `audio-codec` crate in
    a fallback path when symphonia declines the tag. Decoder output is verified
    against an independent ffmpeg/libavcodec reference decode.
  - Headerless raw `.ulaw` / `.alaw` / `.g722` streams (RTP dumps, Asterisk
    Monitor raw) via the new `?codec=pcmu|pcma|g722` query parameter with a
    mandatory `sample_rate` (G.722 accepts `8000`, the SDP clock-rate
    convention, or `16000` and always decodes to its native 16 kHz). A raw
    stream posted without `codec` is still rejected with `422 invalid_audio`.
  - CLI parity: `gigastt transcribe call.ulaw --codec pcmu --sample-rate 8000`.
- **Segment-level confidence on every transcript surface.** `final`/`partial`
  WebSocket messages, SSE stream events, and the REST `/v1/transcribe` JSON
  response now carry an optional `confidence` field: the duration-weighted
  average of the segment's per-word softmax scores (plain average when every
  word has zero duration; omitted when the segment has no words). It is an
  average of word scores, not a calibrated segment probability. Additive and
  omitted-when-absent, so existing clients are unaffected.
- **Swift package is remotely installable via the `gigastt-swift` mirror repo.**
  SwiftPM requires `Package.swift` at the repository root, so the monorepo
  subdirectory could never be consumed by URL; the new
  [ekhodzitsky/gigastt-swift](https://github.com/ekhodzitsky/gigastt-swift)
  mirror carries the manifest at its root and is tagged with engine releases
  (`from: "2.13.0"` and up). On every xcframework release the workflow now
  rewrites the manifest's `url:`/`checksum:` automatically (no more manual
  placeholders), mirrors the package to `gigastt-swift` with the matching tag,
  and re-resolves it end to end on a clean runner; a pre-flight step validates
  the mirror token in seconds instead of failing the push after a 40-minute
  build.
- **Session limits advertised in the WebSocket `ready` message.** The payload
  now always includes `max_session_secs` and `idle_timeout_secs` from the
  server configuration, so clients can plan a reconnect before the server
  closes the socket with `max_session_duration_exceeded` or an idle timeout
  instead of discovering the caps by getting cut off. Additive; protocol
  version stays `1.0`.

### Changed

- **UniFFI binding error type renamed: `GigasttError` → `GigasttFfiError`.**
  The generated Swift/Kotlin/Python bindings previously shadowed the core
  `GigasttError` name and collapsed every core error into a single `Inference`
  variant. The binding type is now `GigasttFfiError` (Kotlin:
  `GigasttFfiException`) with an explicit per-variant mapping, so binding
  errors no longer drift from the core. **Breaking for consumers of the
  UniFFI bindings** (catch clauses and imports need the new name); the
  hand-written SwiftPM wrapper API is unchanged.
- **WebSocket protocol fully documented for integrators.** The `docs/api.md`
  WebSocket section is now a complete human-readable reference — every `ready`,
  `partial`/`final` (including per-word `start`/`end`/`confidence`/`speaker`),
  and `error` field, the `configure`/`stop` semantics (`stop` flushes trailing
  audio and emits a last `final` — the explicit end-of-stream marker), the full
  error-code and close-code tables, keepalive behavior, `/health` vs `/ready`
  lifecycle (including the bootstrap responder and the `version` field for
  version gates without exec-ing the binary), and session/frame limits with
  guidance for >1 h sessions. `docs/troubleshooting.md` gains the matching
  failure scenarios: port-already-in-use and orphaned sidecars, the one-hour
  session cap, raw lowercase WS finals, slow first run, pre-2.0.14 CoreML
  builds, a capture/startup/config triage checklist, and log-sharing hygiene.
- **File-transcription duration cap lowered from 2 hours to 30 minutes.** The cap
  bounds the fully decoded PCM buffer of an upload; 30 minutes ≈ the largest
  uncompressed PCM16@16kHz file the default 50 MiB body limit admits and bounds
  the decoded f32 buffer at ~346 MB per concurrent decode (down from ~1.4 GB),
  closing a >27× memory-amplification vector on compressed uploads. Chunked
  long-form decoding is unaffected below the cap.

### Fixed

- **The metrics listener now honors the bind-consent gate.** `--metrics-listen`
  previously bypassed the loopback-by-default check that guards the main port;
  a non-loopback metrics address now also requires `--bind-all` (or
  `GIGASTT_ALLOW_BIND_ANY=1`), closing an accidental-exposure path.
- **`Content-Disposition` filenames are sanitized per RFC 6266.** Export
  downloads now send an ASCII-sanitized quoted `filename=` fallback plus a
  percent-encoded `filename*=UTF-8''…`, so a crafted upload filename can no
  longer inject header parameters.
- **Interrupted model downloads no longer leave orphaned `.partial` files.**
  A RAII guard removes the staged file on any path that does not reach the
  final atomic rename.
- **Finished jobs no longer pin their upload in RAM.** A `Done`/`Failed` job used
  to keep its raw audio body for the full `--jobs-ttl-secs` (up to
  `--jobs-max` × body-limit of dead audio); the body is now released as soon as
  execution ends (retries keep it for the next attempt).
- **Per-job SSE subscriber list is bounded.** `GET /v1/jobs/{id}/events` now
  prunes closed channels on subscribe and caps listeners at 32 per job (oldest
  evicted), so a connect/disconnect flood can no longer accumulate senders
  between broadcasts.

### Docs

- **The GigaSTT Workbook — a full bilingual cookbook (EN + RU) on GitHub Pages.**
  <https://ekhodzitsky.github.io/gigastt/> is a complete scenario-driven book
  (mdBook, built and deployed by a new `docs.yml` workflow on every change):
  getting started, CLI & batch processing, telephony & VoIP, streaming over
  WebSocket, desktop & embedded (Swift/SPM, sidecar, Electron, UniFFI),
  deployment & ops, and models & backends. Recipes were verified live against
  the model and server. The English book is canonical; the Russian mirror
  keeps an identical chapter structure.
- **Docs-drift gate in CI (advisory).** A fast checker now compares
  `docs/cli.md` flags against the CLI definition, the WS error-code table
  against `asyncapi.yaml` and the server code, documented audio formats
  against the decoder, mdBook TOCs against chapter files, EN/RU parity, and
  every relative link in the docs. Its first sweep fixed real drift: 35
  undocumented CLI flags/env vars in `docs/cli.md` and a Swift snippet in
  `docs/quickstarts.md` that no longer matched the shipped wrapper.
- **WebSocket protocol fully documented for integrators** (see Changed), and
  a troubleshooting guide covering the failure modes integrators actually hit.
- **Node/Electron path documented.** The npm package README positions
  in-process vs sidecar embedding, `examples/electron_main.mjs` shows the
  OpenOffer-style dual-channel pattern, and the quickstart guide covers the
  Node path.
- **Documentation inventory + archive.** Every file under `docs/` is
  classified (reference / guide / historical) in the workbook intro.
  Completed design documents moved to `docs/archive/`:
  `candle-metal-backend-plan.md` and `candle-metal-backend-design.md`
  (superseded by the shipped backend documented in
  [docs/candle-backend.md](docs/candle-backend.md)).

## [2.13.0] - 2026-07-20

### Added

- **Air-gapped distribution: offline tarball, Debian packages, systemd unit.** Every
  release now ships `gigastt-<ver>-offline-<target>.tar.gz` for both Linux targets —
  binary + pre-quantized INT8 `rnnt` model + punctuation model + hardened systemd unit
  (`ProtectSystem=strict`, `PrivateTmp`, `NoNewPrivileges`; compatible with systemd 241)
  + `install.sh` + an offline README — alongside two Debian packages:
  `gigastt_<ver>_<arch>.deb` (binary, unit, `/etc/gigastt/` config) and
  `gigastt-model-int8_<ver>_all.deb` (model files under `/usr/share/gigastt/models/`).
  All are signed like the other release assets (`.sha256`, `SHA256SUMS.txt`, minisign).
  An installation lands and serves without a single network connection; rpm is
  intentionally deferred (the tarball covers rpm-based distributions). See
  `docs/deployment.md`, "Air-gapped / offline installation".
- **Offline mode: `--offline` / `GIGASTT_OFFLINE=1`.** Every code path that would
  download a model — `gigastt download`, the punctuation / VAD auto-fetch inside
  `serve` — fails fast with an error naming the missing file and where to place it,
  instead of a network timeout. All fetches funnel through a single download function
  in `gigastt-core`, so the guard covers the model download, the pre-quantized bundle,
  ANE packages, and the speaker / punctuation / VAD models alike. The shipped systemd
  unit enables it via `/etc/gigastt/gigastt.env`. The `reqwest` network audit result
  is recorded in `docs/privacy.md`.
- **Machine-readable `gigastt download` progress (`--progress=json`).** A new opt-in
  flag (env `GIGASTT_DOWNLOAD_PROGRESS`) switches model download reporting to NDJSON on
  stdout — one JSON event per line and nothing else on stdout (the human `\r`-progress
  renderer is disabled; tracing logs go to stderr): throttled per-file byte progress
  (`download`), `verify` at each SHA-256 check, `quantize` when the ~2-minute on-device
  INT8 pass starts (previously invisible to integrators and easily mistaken for a hang),
  a terminal `done`, and an `error` event before any non-zero exit. Sidecar integrators
  can now drive an exact progress bar per file and phase instead of polling the model
  directory size. The default `human` mode is unchanged. `gigastt download` failures
  also gain a documented, sysexits-flavored exit-code taxonomy — `69` network, `74`
  disk, `65` checksum, `130` interrupted (Ctrl-C), `1` other — keeping the historical
  `!= 0` failure contract; `2` is deliberately left to clap's usage errors so a
  misconfigured invocation is never mistaken for a transient network failure. Ctrl-C
  stays responsive through the whole run, including the synchronous quantize pass. See
  [docs/cli.md](docs/cli.md).
- **Client SDKs for the WebSocket protocol: `gigastt-go` and `@gigastt/client` (TypeScript).**
  Two idiomatic, typed clients of protocol v1.0 under `sdks/` — typed
  `Ready`/`Partial`/`Final`/`Error` events (all fields, including `words[]`, `code`, and
  `retry_after_ms`), a single socket writer, reconnect with exponential backoff that honors
  the server's `retry_after_ms` on pool saturation, and context/AbortSignal lifecycles. The
  TypeScript package runs on Node and in browsers (global `WebSocket` with an injectable
  transport and `ws` fallback). Both ship mock-server test suites (run in CI on `sdks/`
  changes) plus a live-server integration test gated on `GIGASTT_TEST_WS_URL`, and README
  quickstarts. Additive protocol fields are ignored by design, matching the compatibility
  convention. Package publication (npm / Go module tags) is a separate release step.

### Fixed

- **WebSocket resampling no longer resets filter state when frame sizes grow.** The cached
  streaming resampler used to be recreated whenever a frame arrived that was larger than any
  seen before, discarding the FIR history and fractional phase mid-stream — audible as clicks
  or seams at frame boundaries for non-16 kHz WebSocket sessions with variable frame sizes
  (typically the first seconds of a stream, while frame sizes ramp up). The resampler is now
  built once per session with a fixed capacity; variable-sized frames are applied via
  `set_chunk_size`, which preserves filter state, and frames larger than the capacity are fed
  through the same instance in capacity-sized pieces. Verified by an equivalence test against
  a one-shot resample of the same signal.

## [2.12.0] - 2026-07-20

### Added

- **Streaming `final` segments now carry ITN + punctuation/casing restoration.** Both the
  WebSocket and SSE streaming paths post-process each segment at its finalization boundary
  (endpoint flush / stop flush) with the same policy as file transcription: inverse text
  normalization first, then punctuation/casing restoration when a punctuation model is
  attached (`--punctuation` / `--itn`, default `auto` = on for the bare `rnnt` head, off
  for `e2e_rnnt`, which is already punctuated by the model). `partial` messages stay the
  raw decoder hypothesis, and `words[]` payloads keep the raw output — only the joined
  `text` is rewritten, exactly like the file path. Live-dictation clients no longer have
  to choose between streaming previews and readable transcripts.
  - Additive WS `configure` fields `punctuation` / `itn` override the server policy per
    session (sent before the first audio frame; an omitted field keeps the server
    default; `punctuation: true` on a server without a punctuation model is a graceful
    no-op). The overrides survive mid-session state recreation (diarization
    reconfiguration, post-panic session reset). SSE follows the server boot policy —
    per-request parameters for `/v1/transcribe/stream` are not part of this release.
  - Measured cost at the finalization boundary: `restore` on 1–10-word segments is
    p95 ≈ 0.5–1.0 ms (debug build, Apple Silicon) — roughly two orders of magnitude under
    a 100 ms budget, so enrichment runs unconditionally regardless of segment length.
  - The `ClientMessage::Configure` struct variant is now `#[non_exhaustive]` (match it
    with a `..` rest pattern): the wire protocol grows by additive optional fields, and
    the marking lets future ones ship as minor releases.

## [2.11.3] - 2026-07-19

### Fixed

- **Offline file transcription no longer diarizes unless asked.** After the 2.11.2 WeSpeaker
  fix made the speaker encoder actually work, every `/v1/transcribe` (and SSE stream) began
  attaching speaker labels whenever the diarization model was present — ignoring the opt-in
  `?diarization=true` parameter and, in particular, labelling the `channels=split` dual-mono
  fallback. Offline speaker diarization is now gated on the request: a plain transcript carries
  no `speaker` fields, and only `?diarization=true` runs the speaker pass. Streaming (WebSocket)
  was already correctly gated. Adds the additive `Engine::transcribe_bytes_shared_with_overrides_diarized`
  entry point.

## [2.11.2] - 2026-07-19

### Fixed

- **Speaker diarization now feeds WeSpeaker the expected fbank features.** The previous legacy
  extractor passed rank-2 raw waveform tensors to a rank-3 feature model, so offline and streaming
  diarization logged `Got: 2 Expected: 3` and returned transcripts without speaker labels.

## [2.11.1] - 2026-07-19

### Fixed

- **`--model-variant` is now honored when a model directory holds more than one head.**
  Previously the engine re-detected the head from the files on disk (with `rnnt` precedence)
  at load time, so `--model-variant e2e_rnnt` (or any non-default head) was silently ignored
  whenever a directory contained more than one head's files — the highest-precedence head
  loaded instead. The resolved variant is now threaded through to the engine loader, so the
  requested head is the one that loads (and the load fails with a clear error if that head's
  files are absent). With no `--model-variant`, on-disk auto-detection is unchanged. Adds the
  additive `Engine::load_with_pools_threads_variant` entry point.

## [2.11.0] - 2026-07-17

### Added

- **GigaAM Multilingual charwise-CTC recognition heads (`--model-variant ml_ctc` /
  `ml_ctc_large`).** Two opt-in heads alongside `rnnt` and `e2e_rnnt`, built on Salute's
  GigaAM Multilingual encoders (220M and 600M, released June 2026; MIT). Trained across 70+
  languages with best-in-class WER on Russian, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, and Uzbek (moderate on
  English); the recognition vocabulary is a 71-class multilingual character set (Latin +
  Cyrillic + Kazakh/Turkic letters). Output is bare lowercase (no punctuation / casing /
  ITN), so pair it with `--punctuation` / `--itn` for readable Russian text, the same as the
  `rnnt` head.
  - `gigastt download --model-variant ml_ctc` (220M, ~225 MB) or `ml_ctc_large` (600M,
    ~592 MB) fetches the pre-quantized INT8 encoder and vocabulary directly from
    `istupakov/gigaam-multilingual-ctc-onnx` / `-large-ctc-onnx` on HuggingFace — no FP32
    download and no on-device quantization (the upstream INT8 encoder is used as-is). Both
    files are SHA-256-verified. The two heads share a byte-identical vocabulary.
  - The heads share the existing 64-mel / FFT 320 / hop 160 frontend, so no audio-pipeline
    changes are needed; they are encoder-only (a single ONNX with a CTC projection, greedy
    CTC decoding — no prediction network / joiner).
  - `serve`, `download`, and `transcribe` accept `ml_ctc` / `ml_ctc_large` (with `-` aliases)
    via `--model-variant` (or `GIGASTT_MODEL_VARIANT`); the engine also auto-detects the head
    from the encoder present on disk. REST `/v1/models` reports them as
    `gigaam-multilingual-ctc` / `gigaam-multilingual-large-ctc`.
- **Benchmark WER for the Multilingual CTC heads across all five supported languages**
  (`docs/benchmarks.md`). Clean-read WER for the 600M head: Russian 4.44% (`golos_crowd_1k`),
  English 4.63% (LibriSpeech `test-clean`), Kazakh 6.52% / Kyrgyz 7.39% / Uzbek 9.21% (FLEURS,
  digit-free) — 4.4–9.2% across languages; the 220M head is 6.15–11.96%. The Russian-only
  `rnnt` / `e2e_rnnt` heads are Cyrillic-only (100% WER on English). Adds the `gigastt-ml-ctc`
  / `gigastt-ml-ctc-large` benchmark runners and `scripts/prepare_librispeech.py`,
  `scripts/prepare_fleurs.py`, `scripts/wer_unicode.py` (a Unicode-complete WER with the
  number / apostrophe normalization these languages need). Russian phone / YouTube WER are not
  measured (no local reference audio).

### Fixed

- **The SSE streaming endpoint (`POST /v1/transcribe/stream`) now reserves a batch-pool
  slot before decoding the upload**, capping the number of concurrent audio decodes at the
  pool size. Previously the handler expanded each compressed upload to f32 PCM before
  checking out a pool slot, so a burst of large uploads (up to the body-size limit) could
  each inflate into a multi-hundred-megabyte buffer simultaneously and exhaust memory. The
  endpoint now returns `503` + `Retry-After` under pool saturation, matching the synchronous
  `/v1/transcribe` handler.

## [2.10.0] - 2026-07-15

### Added

- **Asynchronous Job API for long-file and batch transcription (`/v1/jobs`).** Disabled by
  default; enable with `--enable-jobs` or `GIGASTT_ENABLE_JOBS=1`. When disabled the
  `/v1/jobs` routes are not registered and return 404.
  - `POST /v1/jobs` accepts the same body and query parameters as `/v1/transcribe`
    (`format`, `word_timestamps`, `segments`, `channels`, `punctuation`, `itn`, `vad`, etc.)
    and returns `202 {"job_id","status":"queued","created_at"}`.
  - `GET /v1/jobs/{id}` returns the job lifecycle (`queued|processing|done|failed|cancelled`),
    an estimate of processed audio seconds, and a `percent` derived from `processed/total`.
    Errors are sanitized and never leak paths or model internals.
  - `GET /v1/jobs/{id}/result` returns the finished transcript in the format requested at
    submission; `409 job_not_finished` while running, `404` for unknown/expired jobs.
  - `DELETE /v1/jobs/{id}` cancels queued or processing jobs and broadcasts a `cancelled`
    event to any SSE listeners.
  - `GET /v1/jobs/{id}/events` is an SSE stream of `progress`, `done`, `failed`, and
    `cancelled` events; the stream closes automatically after a terminal event.
  - The in-memory FIFO queue respects `--batch-pool-size` (default 0, clamped to at least 1
    job worker), limits concurrent batch jobs so they cannot starve WebSocket / synchronous
    REST traffic, and retries up to `--jobs-retry` (default 3) on `inference_timeout` or panic.
    Finished/failed/cancelled jobs are evicted after `--jobs-ttl-secs` (default 3600) or when
    `--jobs-max` (default 100) is reached, at which point `POST /v1/jobs` returns
    `429 queue_full` with `Retry-After`.
  - Graceful shutdown cancels all queued jobs; any in-flight job is allowed to finish within
    the existing drain window and its triplet is returned to the pool.

## [2.9.0] - 2026-07-14

### Changed

- **`?segments=true` groups words at natural boundaries and carries speaker labels.**
  Segment grouping on `POST /v1/transcribe` moves from the cue-sized windows shared with
  the `srt` / `vtt` exports to natural boundaries: a new segment starts on an inter-word
  pause (> 0.9 s), after sentence-ending punctuation (`.` `!` `?`), on a speaker change,
  or at a 30 s duration cap. When diarization or the stereo channel-speaker mode supplied
  labels, each segment gains an additive `speaker` field; `format=md&segments=true`
  section headers follow the same boundaries. The `srt` / `vtt` caption exports keep
  their cue-sized grouping unchanged, and the default response without `segments=true`
  stays byte-for-byte identical.

## [2.8.0] - 2026-07-10

### Added

- **Per-request recognition-knob overrides on `POST /v1/transcribe`.** Three additive,
  optional query params let a single running server vary the post-processing knobs per
  request instead of only at boot: `?punctuation=true|false` (punctuation / casing
  restoration pass), `?itn=true|false` (inverse text normalization, number-words →
  digits), and `?vad=true|false` (VAD silence-skipping). An absent param falls back to
  the server's boot policy, so the default response is byte-for-byte unchanged. A knob
  can only be turned *on* per-request when its backing resource is loaded: `?vad=true`
  on a server started without `--vad` returns `409 vad_not_loaded`, and
  `?punctuation=true` with no punctuation model returns `409 punctuation_not_available`
  — both validated before any pool checkout (fail-fast). Turning a knob *off*, and ITN
  in either direction, is always accepted. A forward-compatibility `?variant=<head>`
  guard returns `409 variant_not_loaded` when the requested head differs from the loaded
  one (a single-model server can't switch heads; matching or absent proceeds). Scope:
  `POST /v1/transcribe` only — the SSE `/v1/transcribe/stream` and WebSocket paths do not
  run the punctuation / ITN passes, so the punctuation / ITN knobs don't apply there.
  Deferred: per-request hotword biasing and multi-model variant switching.

## [2.7.0] - 2026-07-10

### Added

- **Segment-level output on `POST /v1/transcribe` (`?segments=true`).** The default JSON
  response gains an additive `segments` array — `[{start, end, text, words:[…]}]` — that
  groups words into cue-sized segments, sharing the exact boundaries used by the `srt` /
  `vtt` exports (one grouping source), while the top-level `text` / `words` / `duration`
  stay unchanged. Combined with `format=md`, `segments=true` switches Markdown to
  `### [mm:ss]` (widening to `[hh:mm:ss]` past an hour) section headers per segment instead
  of the flat `# Transcript` blob. Fully opt-in: the default response and plain `format=md`
  are byte-unchanged, and `txt` / `srt` / `vtt` ignore the flag (already flat / cue-based).
- **Model hot-reload without a restart.** A new loopback-only `POST /v1/admin/reload`
  rebuilds the inference engine from the exact boot recipe (model dir, pool sizes,
  encoder threads, and the punctuation / ITN / VAD / hotword chain) and atomically
  swaps it in. The new engine is warmed before the swap so the first request after a
  reload pays no cold-start cost, and a build failure leaves the currently-serving
  engine untouched (the server is never left without a model). In-flight requests keep
  the engine they started on and finish against its pool. The endpoint is restricted to
  loopback callers by an explicit peer-IP check that holds even under `--bind-all` /
  `--cors-allow-any`; a second concurrent reload is rejected with `409`. The endpoint
  is also exempt from the per-IP rate limiter — an operator triggering a reload is
  gated by the 409/403 logic, not the token bucket. Returns
  `200 {"reloaded":true,"variant":…,"encoder":"int8"|"fp32"}` on success.

## [2.6.0] - 2026-07-09

### Added

- Per-request RTF `info!` log on every completed file transcription (audio seconds, wall seconds, RTF, encoder label `int8/cpu` etc.); covers CLI `transcribe`, REST `/v1/transcribe`, and SSE — not the streaming WebSocket path.
- `warn!` when the INT8 quantized encoder is missing and the engine falls back to the FP32 encoder on the default ORT path; names the one-line fix (`gigastt download` or `gigastt quantize`). Suppressed for candle and ANE builds, which have their own model formats.

### Changed

- **CPU encoder now uses all cores by default (`--encoder-intra-threads`).** When the
  flag / `GIGASTT_ENCODER_INTRA_THREADS` env is left unset, the encoder intra-op thread
  count now defaults to the machine's logical CPU count divided across the
  concurrently-running pool triplets (`serve`: `pool_size + batch_pool_size`; offline
  `transcribe`: a single triplet), instead of the previous fixed `1`. A default install
  on an N-core box now decodes across the available cores rather than pinning one. An
  explicit value (flag or env, including `1`) is still honoured verbatim, and the
  resolved count continues to be auto-clamped so `pool_size * threads` can't oversubscribe
  the logical CPUs. No effect on the CoreML / CUDA / ANE builds, where the accelerator owns
  scheduling. The Docker `CMD` needs no override to benefit.

### Fixed

- **Integer-overflow panic on a crafted APEv2 tag header.** A 36-byte APEv2 tag
  (APE tags can ride on MP3 uploads) with an unbounded `size` field made
  `symphonia-metadata`'s `size + 32` overflow and panic with "attempt to add
  with overflow", reachable from the audio-upload path. A vendored one-line guard
  (`saturating_add`) in `symphonia-metadata` turns the crafted header into a clean
  decode error instead of a panic, and the SSE `/v1/transcribe/stream` decode is
  now wrapped in `catch_unwind` (matching the REST handler) so any future
  decode-path panic is absorbed as a 422 rather than surfacing as a 500.

## [2.5.0] - 2026-06-24

### Added

- **Optional native ANE (Core ML) encoder backend (`--features ane`, macOS ARM64).**
  Runs the GigaAM v3 `rnnt` **encoder** on the Apple **Neural Engine** via per-bucket
  fixed-shape Core ML `.mlpackage`s; the decoder/joiner stay on the `ort` CPU path.
  Strictly opt-in and additive — the default `ort` build is unchanged. File-mode:
  each encoder window is padded up to the nearest fixed bucket (ladder `512/768/1536/3000`
  mel frames), run FP16 on the ANE, and trimmed back; windows below the 50% fill
  floor — including every streaming window — transparently fall back to the `ort`
  encoder (no crash, no ANE benefit). Warm end-to-end ≈ 10× over the CPU build
  (encoder ~15× on the Neural Engine; the RNN-T greedy decode and feature extraction
  stay on the CPU and become the larger share once the encoder is offloaded). A
  compiled-model disk cache cuts the ~20 s first-load to ~0.1 s on later starts.
  WER vs `ort` ≈ 1.11% (one borderline FP16-pad-up token flip on a 15-clip Golos
  set, else byte-identical).
  The smallest (512) bucket serves typical 3–5 s clips at higher fill, cutting the
  pad-up waste — and the encoder latency — versus routing them up to the 768 bucket.
  Distinct from `--features coreml` (the ort CoreML EP); mutually exclusive with
  `coreml`/`cuda`/`nnapi`/`candle`; `rnnt` head only (`e2e_rnnt` falls back to `ort`).
  Bucket packages download via `gigastt download --ane` (published at the
  `ane-v3-2026-06-24` release) or convert locally via `scripts/convert_gigaam_ane.py`.
  See [`docs/ane-backend.md`](docs/ane-backend.md).

## [2.4.0] - 2026-06-23

### Added

- **Optional Candle / Metal inference backend (`--features candle`, experimental).**
  A pure-Rust alternative to the default ONNX Runtime path that runs the GigaAM v3
  `rnnt` encoder, decoder (LSTM prediction network), and joiner on the Apple Silicon
  **Metal GPU** (Candle's CPU backend elsewhere). Strictly opt-in and additive — the
  default `ort` build is unchanged and remains the default. Transcription is
  **byte-for-byte identical to the `ort` backend** on the benchmark fixtures
  (per-stage numeric parity ~1e-6; whole-file and streaming transcripts identical).
  Weights convert from the local ONNX models via `scripts/convert_gigaam_candle.py`
  (no PyTorch or extra download). Mutually exclusive with `coreml`/`cuda`/`nnapi`;
  `rnnt` head only (e2e_rnnt falls back to `ort`). See
  [`docs/candle-backend.md`](docs/candle-backend.md).
- **Prebuilt Docker images on GitHub Container Registry.** Each tagged release
  now publishes `ghcr.io/ekhodzitsky/gigastt:{X.Y.Z,latest}` (CPU, multi-arch
  linux/amd64 + linux/arm64) and `:{X.Y.Z-cuda,cuda}` (CUDA, linux/amd64), so
  consumers can `docker pull` a versioned image instead of building from
  `cargo install` in their own Dockerfile. The publish job is independent of the
  binary GitHub release (a registry hiccup never blocks the tarballs and vice
  versa). See [`docs/deployment.md`](docs/deployment.md).
- **Non-blocking first-run boot.** The TCP listener now binds *before* the
  first-run model download + INT8 quantization (which can take minutes). During
  that window a minimal bootstrap responder answers `GET /health` with `200`
  (`model: "loading"`) and `GET /ready` with `503 {"reason":"initializing"}`,
  then the *same* bound socket is handed to the full server with no rebind — so
  `curl --fail /health` and Docker `HEALTHCHECK` no longer see connection-refused
  (indistinguishable from a crash) while the model loads. A shutdown signal
  during loading exits cleanly without serving. The heavy load work runs on a
  blocking thread so the bootstrap responder stays responsive.
- **Node.js binding: the `gigastt` npm package (napi-rs).** `crates/gigastt-node`
  wraps the engine in an idiomatic JS API — `new Engine(modelDir, poolSize?)`,
  `engine.transcribeFile(path)`, `stream.processChunk(pcm16, sampleRate)` /
  `stream.flush()` — running inference on a libuv worker thread via napi's
  `AsyncTask` (Promises, never blocking the event loop), with failures thrown as
  JS `Error`s prefixed by a stable code (`ModelNotFound`, `InvalidAudio`,
  `PoolExhausted`, `Inference`) matching the C-ABI / UniFFI contract across
  bindings. It is a single JS-only package: the postinstall downloads exactly one
  prebuilt `gigastt.<platform>.node` — onnxruntime statically linked, so the addon
  is self-contained — from the `node-v<version>` GitHub release. Prebuilt
  platforms: `darwin-arm64`, `linux-x64-gnu`, `linux-arm64-gnu`, `win32-x64-msvc`
  (Intel macOS omitted — ort ships no onnxruntime for it), built per native runner
  by the Node Prebuilds workflow. Desktop JS (Electron) gets an in-process engine
  with no sidecar to spawn. See `crates/gigastt-node/README.md`.
- **Pre-quantized INT8 model bundle: `gigastt download --prequantized`.**
  Integrators can now skip the ~844 MB FP32 encoder download, the ~2-minute
  on-device INT8 quantization pass, and the `protoc` build dependency by fetching
  a pre-quantized bundle (INT8 encoder + decoder + joiner + vocab) directly from a
  pinned GitHub Release; the engine prefers the INT8 encoder and runs from this
  set alone (verified: an INT8-only model directory loads and transcribes). The
  bundle is quantized for both heads, SHA-256 pinned, minisign-signed, and
  published by the `release-model` workflow. Intended for embedding and
  air-gapped installs.
- **Android AAR packaging pipeline (experimental).** `packaging/android/` is a
  Gradle library module (JNA + UniFFI-generated Kotlin, `jniLibs` source sets,
  consumer ProGuard rules), and the `android-aar` workflow cross-builds
  `libgigastt_uniffi.so` for `arm64-v8a` / `armeabi-v7a` / `x86_64` with
  cargo-ndk, generates the Kotlin bindings, and assembles the AAR (Maven
  publication gated on credentials). The same release also ships FFI tarballs —
  `gigastt-ffi` cdylib + staticlib + the cbindgen C header, onnxruntime
  statically linked — for `x86_64` and `aarch64` Linux, a drop-in embedding
  artifact for ARM servers and Raspberry Pi.
- **iOS xcframework + SwiftPM package.** `packaging/swift/` ships a SwiftPM
  package (swift-tools 5.9, iOS 15+) whose binary target wraps
  `GigasttFFI.xcframework` — the `gigastt-ffi` static library with onnxruntime
  statically linked, so each slice is self-contained — plus a safe Swift wrapper
  over the C ABI: `Engine` (`transcribeFile`) and `Stream` (`processChunk` /
  `flush`) with RAII handle management, typed `GigasttError`, and Codable structs
  matching the streaming JSON. The release workflow builds the xcframework and
  pins its URL/checksum into `Package.swift`.

### Changed

- **`/health`, `/v1/models`, and the WebSocket `Ready` frame now report the head
  actually loaded.** They previously hardcoded `model: "gigaam-v3-e2e-rnnt"`
  regardless of which head was running, so a default `rnnt` server misreported
  itself as `e2e_rnnt`. `model`/`id` are now derived from the loaded variant
  (`gigaam-v3-rnnt` vs `gigaam-v3-e2e-rnnt`), and `/health` + `/v1/models` gain
  additive `variant` (`rnnt`/`e2e_rnnt`), `punctuation`, and `itn` fields so a
  client can confirm the effective output style from a single probe. New fields
  are additive (existing clients unaffected); OpenAPI updated to match.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-06-20

This release makes the lower-WER `rnnt` head the default and lands the INT8
integer-compute speed fix, voice activity detection, contextual hotword biasing,
punctuation/ITN restoration for the `rnnt` head, export formats, dual-WER benchmark
scoring, and a ~2× lower idle footprint. Re-measured through the cross-engine harness
(same manifests/normalization as the competitors), the `rnnt` head is **the most
accurate engine on 3 of 4 Russian domains** — far-field **4.08%**, phone **18.50%**,
YouTube **10.91%** — and a **statistical tie with Vosk 0.54 on clean read** (**3.55%**
vs 2.97%, CIs overlap), down from the old `e2e` default's 8.60%. **RTF ~0.10**,
**790 MB** RSS at the default `--pool-size 2`, INT8 encoder 844 MB → 215 MB (3.9×).
See [`docs/benchmarks.md`](docs/benchmarks.md).

### Changed

- **Greedy decode loop no longer allocates per token.** `run_decoder` / the joiner
  step now reuse buffers (`copy_from_slice`) instead of allocating fresh `Vec`s per
  non-blank token, removing millions of per-token heap allocations on long clips. The
  blank-run decoder-output cache is preserved and decode output is bit-identical. (A
  joiner encoder-projection precompute and ort IoBinding are possible future work.)
- **INT8 encoder now uses dynamic integer compute (`MatMulInteger`/`ConvInteger`).**
  `gigastt-core::quantize` previously emitted weight-only `DequantizeLinear`, which ONNX
  Runtime constant-folds back to FP32 at load — so the "INT8" encoder ran as FP32 (no
  speedup, full FP32 memory). It now emits `DynamicQuantizeLinear` on activations plus
  `MatMulInteger`/`ConvInteger` integer kernels (matching the upstream pre-quantized
  format), so the CPU EP runs true INT8 compute. Measured on an M-series CPU: encoder
  RTF drops from ~1.3 (slower than real time) to well below 0.1, a ~13–30× single-stream
  speedup, with the transcript unchanged. The `gigastt quantize` CLI and the
  auto-quantize-on-first-run behavior are unchanged.
- **Lower idle memory footprint: default `--pool-size` is now 2 (was 4), plus an
  automatic RAM-aware pool cap.** Each pooled session triplet deserializes its
  own copy of the encoder weights — ORT's shared `PrepackedWeights` container
  shares prepacked kernel buffers, not the raw initializer tensors, and this ORT
  version exposes no stable cross-session initializer-sharing path (the
  in-memory `use_ort_model_bytes_for_initializers` route was measured *worse*,
  not better, for our self-contained INT8 graph). A pooled INT8 triplet costs
  ~0.4 GB resident, so the default server footprint drops from ~2.0 GB to
  ~1.0 GB. The server now also clamps `--pool-size` at load so the pooled
  encoders stay under half of total system RAM, logging a warning when it has to
  reduce concurrency — this prevents a large `--pool-size` from OOM-ing a small
  host. The cap never *raises* the requested size and is a no-op on hosts with
  ample memory. Raise `--pool-size` for higher concurrency when RAM allows.

### Added

- **Voice activity detection (`--vad`, opt-in, off by default).** Optional Silero
  v5 VAD (MIT, ~2 MB ONNX) loaded through the existing `ort` runtime — no extra
  dependency. Enables two things: file transcription **skips silence** (decodes
  only detected speech regions, then remaps word timestamps back to the original
  timeline) for a speedup proportional to the silence fraction; and WebSocket
  streaming gains **VAD endpointing** (finalizes a segment on detected trailing
  silence, augmenting the decoder's blank-run heuristic). The model auto-downloads
  to `--vad-model-dir` (default `~/.gigastt/models/vad/`) with SHA-256
  verification on first use. Tunables: `--vad-threshold` (default 0.5),
  `--vad-min-silence-ms` (default 500); env `GIGASTT_VAD`, `GIGASTT_VAD_THRESHOLD`,
  `GIGASTT_VAD_MIN_SILENCE_MS`, `GIGASTT_VAD_MODEL_DIR`. VAD is strictly
  non-blocking: a missing model or inference error logs a warning and proceeds
  without VAD. **Default OFF: with no `--vad`, decoding is byte-for-byte
  unchanged** (full buffer decoded; streaming endpointing unchanged).
- **Verbatim ("naive") WER reported alongside normalized WER in the benchmark.**
  Both the Python (`benchmark.py`) and Rust (`crates/gigastt/tests/benchmark.rs`)
  harnesses now compute a second WER per sample with verbatim rules only
  (lowercase + `ё`→`е` + strip non-word characters, but no words-to-digits ITN,
  digit-group merging, or anglicism mapping) and surface `naive_wer`, its 95% CI,
  and `naive_delta = wer - naive_wer`. A negative delta means writing convention
  (number style, punctuation, transliteration) — not acoustics — produced the WER
  gap, which separates genuine recognition error from formatting. The Python
  results table gains `naive %` / `Δ pp` columns. The Rust regression gate still
  decides pass/fail on the normalized WER only; the verbatim numbers are
  reported, never gated.
- **Configurable encoder threads (`--encoder-intra-threads`).** The CPU encoder runs
  single-threaded by default; on weak CPUs or long single-file jobs it can now take more
  intra-op threads (env `GIGASTT_ENCODER_INTRA_THREADS`, default 1 — unchanged), clamped so
  `pool_size × threads` stays within the logical CPU count. Decoder/joiner and the
  CoreML/CUDA paths are untouched.
- **Chunked long-form file decoding (bounded peak memory).** File transcription now
  splits long audio into overlapping ~24 s windows, decodes each independently, and
  stitches the words (overlap de-dup, monotonic timestamps) — peak encoder activation
  memory is O(chunk) instead of O(file), removing the OOM risk on long inputs. Short
  files keep the single-pass path unchanged; the hard duration cap is raised accordingly.
- **Contextual hotword biasing (`--hotwords-file` / `--hotwords-boost`).** Optional
  token-level shallow-fusion biasing inside the existing greedy RNN-T loop (no beam
  search): a trie over hotword phrases — each tokenized to the active vocabulary —
  boosts the joiner logits of tokens that extend an active hotword prefix, so brands,
  names, and domain terms are recognized more reliably. Works for both heads (char and
  BPE vocabularies). A curated Russian brand/acronym lexicon ships as the default pack.
  Default OFF: with no hotwords configured, decoding is byte-for-byte unchanged. Env
  `GIGASTT_HOTWORDS_FILE` / `GIGASTT_HOTWORDS_BOOST`.
- **Inverse text normalization for the `rnnt` head (`--itn`).** An optional
  post-processing pass converts spelled-out Russian numbers into digits
  (e.g. `шестьдесят тысяч` → `60000`, `две тысячи двадцать` → `2020`). It runs
  **before** the punctuation pass, so the combined pipeline turns
  `шестьдесят тысяч тенге сколько будет стоить` into
  `60 000 тенге, сколько будет стоить?`. `--itn <auto|on|off>`
  (env `GIGASTT_ITN`, default `auto` = on for `rnnt`, off for `e2e_rnnt` which
  already digitizes numbers). The number-word table and the words→digits state
  machine are a verbatim port of the WER benchmark normalizer, so online and
  offline number handling stay symmetric.
- **Punctuation model auto-download.** The RUPunct ONNX artifact is now published
  at `ekhodzitsky/rupunct-small-onnx` (public, MIT) and downloads automatically
  into `--punct-model-dir` (with SHA-256 verification + atomic rename) the first
  time the punctuation pass is enabled, so `--punctuation on` works out of the
  box. A download failure is logged and swallowed — transcription is never
  blocked.
- **Punctuation + capitalization restoration for the `rnnt` head
  (`--punctuation`).** An optional post-processing pass turns the plain `rnnt`
  head's bare lowercase output into properly cased, punctuated Russian
  (e.g. `шестьдесят тысяч тенге сколько будет стоить` →
  `Шестьдесят тысяч тенге, сколько будет стоить?`). Backed by an INT8 ONNX export
  of `RUPunct/RUPunct_small` (MIT, ~29 MB) run via ONNX Runtime with the
  `tokenizers` crate for WordPiece — no Python at runtime. `--punctuation
  <auto|on|off>` (env `GIGASTT_PUNCTUATION`, default `auto` = on for `rnnt`, off
  for `e2e_rnnt` which already punctuates) and `--punct-model-dir`
  (env `GIGASTT_PUNCT_MODEL_DIR`, default `~/.gigastt/models/punct/`). The pass is
  fully optional: if the model is absent it logs once and returns the text
  unchanged.
- **Selectable recognition head (`--model-variant rnnt|e2e_rnnt`).** gigastt can now
  run either GigaAM v3 head. The plain `rnnt` head is the default for fresh installs:
  it scores markedly lower WER on bare normalized text (measured ~3.3% vs ~9.6% for
  `e2e_rnnt` on a golos_crowd_1k subset) but emits lowercase text without punctuation.
  `e2e_rnnt` keeps native punctuation, casing, and inverse text normalization. The
  engine auto-detects the installed variant from the files on disk (real filenames per
  variant; the `rnnt` vocab is `v3_vocab.txt`), and the downloader fetches the matching
  set with per-file SHA-256 verification. Existing installs are respected: running
  `serve`/`transcribe` without `--model-variant` uses whatever model is already present
  and never silently re-downloads; an explicit `--model-variant` switches (and never
  mixes variants). Env var `GIGASTT_MODEL_VARIANT`.
- **Dedicated batch pool (`--batch-pool-size`).** Both REST file-transcription
  paths — `/v1/transcribe` and the SSE `/v1/transcribe/stream` (which also
  transcribes a whole upload, holding its triplet for the file's duration) —
  can now draw from a pool of triplets split off from `--pool-size` (env
  `GIGASTT_BATCH_POOL_SIZE`, default `0` = off; clamped to leave at least one
  interactive triplet), so a long batch job no longer starves real-time
  WebSocket streaming, which keeps the interactive pool. New
  `Engine::load_with_pools` / `Engine::pool_for_batch`. When enabled, the batch
  pool exports its own `gigastt_batch_pool_available` / `gigastt_batch_pool_waiters`
  gauges so its saturation is observable separately from the interactive pool.
- **Per-request inference timeout (`--inference-timeout-secs`).** A
  `spawn_blocking` ONNX run that exceeds the timeout (env
  `GIGASTT_INFERENCE_TIMEOUT_SECS`, default 600, `0` disables) now returns a
  typed `inference_timeout` to the client (REST: HTTP 504; WebSocket: error +
  close) instead of hanging the request, with a `gigastt_inference_timeouts_total`
  counter. The default of 600 s comfortably covers a worst-case in-spec
  10-minute (600 s audio) file on the CPU EP, so the advertised upload ceiling
  still works out of the box. The SSE streaming path is not wrapped — each 1 s
  chunk is a small bounded unit and shutdown is handled by a per-chunk
  cancellation check. Note: `spawn_blocking` can't be
  cancelled, so a hung run's triplet returns to the pool only when it
  eventually completes (or at restart) — the timeout unblocks the *client*, not
  the stuck slot.
- **Degraded pool boot (`--pool-min-size`).** When some session triplets fail
  to load (e.g. low memory) the server can now start on a partial pool instead
  of failing outright. `--pool-min-size` (env `GIGASTT_POOL_MIN_SIZE`, default
  1, clamped to `1..=pool_size`) sets the floor: `min <= loaded < pool_size`
  boots with a `degraded pool` warning; fewer than `min` still errors. New
  `Engine::load_with_pool_size_min`; `load_with_pool_size` keeps the strict
  all-or-nothing behavior.
- **Server-side WebSocket keepalive.** The server now pings each WebSocket
  every 30 s and closes the socket after two consecutive unanswered pings
  (any inbound frame resets the counter). Detects half-open TCP sessions and
  keeps connections alive through idle-dropping proxies — far faster than the
  300 s idle timeout.
- **Benchmark regression gate.** `tests/benchmark.rs` loads a committed
  `tests/benchmark_baseline.json` and now **fails** (non-zero exit) when WER
  regresses past `tolerance_pp` — with a printed diff table and a
  `GIGASTT_BENCHMARK_UPDATE_BASELINE=1` refresh path. The absolute `MAX_WER`
  ceiling is a hard failure too; previously it only warned and `pass` was
  hardcoded `true`.
- **Export formats for transcription results.** The REST endpoint
  `/v1/transcribe` now accepts `?format=txt|json|srt|vtt|md` (JSON remains the
  default) and optional formatter controls (`max_chars_per_line`,
  `max_words_per_line`, `word_timestamps`, `download`). The CLI command
  `gigastt transcribe` gained `--format`/`-f`, `--output`/`-o`,
  `--max-chars-per-line`, `--max-words-per-line`, and `--word-timestamps`.
  New `gigastt-core::export` module provides pure formatters; SRT/VTT are
  speaker-aware and Markdown includes YAML frontmatter with `duration`,
  `language: ru`, and `speakers`.

### Changed

- **`/metrics` is now served on a separate loopback listener** (default
  `127.0.0.1:9090`, configurable via `--metrics-listen` / `GIGASTT_METRICS_LISTEN`)
  instead of the primary port. Previously it sat behind the primary CORS
  allowlist and per-IP rate limiter, so any allowlisted browser origin could
  read request telemetry and a 15 s Prometheus scraper could be throttled.
  **Breaking for metrics scrapers:** point Prometheus at the new port (loopback
  by default; expose it deliberately). Requires `--metrics`. A non-loopback
  `--metrics-listen` now requires the same `--bind-all` (or
  `GIGASTT_ALLOW_BIND_ANY=1`) opt-in the primary port does, so telemetry can't
  be exposed network-wide without an explicit, warned acknowledgment.
- **Bounded the Prometheus `path` label** to the known route set (unmatched
  paths collapse to `other`) so scanners hitting arbitrary URLs can no longer
  explode metric label cardinality.

- **polyvoice** 0.6.8 → 0.7.0. Our streaming diarization path (`StreamingPipeline`)
  is still bound on polyvoice's legacy `EmbeddingExtractor` trait, which 0.7.0
  deprecated in favour of the v1.0 `polyvoice::embedder::Embedder` API; the legacy
  usage is annotated `#[allow(deprecated)]` (mirroring polyvoice's own crate-level
  suppression) until upstream wires `Embedder` into the streaming pipeline.

### Fixed

- **INT8 quantization axis.** The quantizer chose `axis=0` for every
  weight; for `MatMul`/`Gemm` weights the per-output-channel axis is the `N`
  dimension, so per-channel scales were grouped along the wrong axis — silently
  inflating INT8 weight error (and WER). The axis is now derived from the
  consuming op (`Conv`→0, `MatMul`→last dim, `Gemm`→`transB`-dependent) and the
  weight is quantized along it with a strided gather. Regenerated INT8 verified
  on the bundled Golos set (1.3% WER, model loads and transcribes cleanly).
- **Monotonic wire timestamps.** `now_timestamp()` is anchored once to a
  process-start `Instant`, so segment timestamps stay epoch-aligned but advance
  monotonically — immune to NTP steps / wall-clock jumps mid-process.
- **AsyncAPI `WordInfo`** now documents `confidence` (required) and
  `speaker` (optional), matching the Rust struct.
- **SSE error parity with WebSocket.** The SSE streaming endpoint
  (`/v1/transcribe/stream`) used to collapse every failure into one generic
  `inference_error` event and stayed silent on a panic. It now emits a stable
  per-variant code (`GigasttError::code()` — `inference_error` / `invalid_audio`
  / …) and a distinct `inference_panic` event when the inference task panics,
  matching the WebSocket error contract.
- **Minor hardening:** single `tokenizer::WORD_BOUNDARY` const for the U+2581
  marker; `MelSpectrogram: Default`; `/health` is liveness-only
  and no longer touches engine state; server shutdown logs a `warn!`
  instead of silently swallowing a oneshot `RecvError`.

## [2.2.1] - 2026-06-18

### Added

- **Disk cache for benchmark transcription results.** Repeated benchmark runs now
  reuse cached hypotheses keyed by runner configuration and audio file SHA-256,
  dramatically reducing iteration time during benchmark development.
- **WER histograms in benchmark output.** Results now include per-runner
  histograms broken down by audio duration, reference word count, and WER bucket.
- **Benchmark profiling flag.** `python benchmark.py --profile` dumps cProfile
  stats to `benchmark.prof` for performance investigation.

### Changed

- **Benchmark runner lifecycle and cache config.** Runner selection now uses a
  module-level class registry to avoid import-time side effects, and the
  `gigastt` runner cache config uses a documented schema-version constant.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-06-14

A large correctness + honesty pass (a full project audit), an honest cross-ASR
benchmark against current Russian-ASR engines, and a reworked README.

### Added

- **Honest cross-ASR benchmark — 7 engines × 4 Russian domains.** gigastt, Vosk 0.42,
  **Vosk 0.54** (Zipformer2 via sherpa-onnx), whisper.cpp, faster-whisper,
  faster-whisper-turbo, and **T-one** (greedy + production beam+LM) on clean read,
  far-field, phone calls and YouTube — with WER + 95% CI, RTF, footprint and an explicit
  training-contamination caveat. See [`docs/benchmarks.md`](docs/benchmarks.md).
- **Release platform matrix expanded** to `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` and
  `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` (cross-compiled), with matching Homebrew coverage.
  (Prebuilt `x86_64-apple-darwin` Intel-Mac tarballs were dropped: GitHub's
  `macos-13` Intel runners are being retired and no longer schedule. Intel-Mac
  users install via `cargo install gigastt`.)
- **Benchmark data licensing** — `benchmark/DATA_LICENSE` + root `NOTICE` carve the
  benchmark transcripts (Open STT CC BY-NC 4.0; Golos Sber Public License) out of the
  project's MIT grant.
- **CI builds the Docker images** (`docker-build` jobs): the CPU image plus a `--version`
  smoke run on every main push and on docker-relevant PRs; the CUDA and benchmark images
  on main push.

### Changed

- **README reworked (EN + RU)** — niche-led, honest positioning (an embeddable on-device
  Russian STT, not a WER-leaderboard claim), ~80 lines, 4 badges, with detail split into
  `docs/{api,benchmarks,architecture,troubleshooting}.md`. Removed unmeasured/false
  claims (sub-200 ms streaming, "only Rust-native"); streaming reframed honestly as
  buffered/chunked over an offline RNN-T (~0.7 s time-to-first-partial).
- **API + docs aligned to the code** — REST / OpenAPI / AsyncAPI error contracts, a
  single flagship WER (8.60% renorm), and consistent test counts / model sizes / MSRV
  across README, CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md.
- **Supply-chain transparency** — documented the build-time onnxruntime fetch (ort's
  default `download-binaries`), and pinned `cargo-ndk` and the benchmark lockfile.
- **MSRV bumped 1.87 → 1.88** (`ort`/`ort-sys` 2.0.0-rc.12 require it). `ort`/`ort-sys`
  remain pinned to the pre-release `2.0.0-rc.12` — no stable `ort` 2.0.x exists yet.

### Fixed

- **Streaming recognition quality** — decode on a sliding context window over the offline
  RNN-T (fixes the isolated-chunk regression that collapsed partials to a single token),
  with a decode stride to stay real-time on CPU; streaming word-timestamp units corrected.
- **Model downloads** now use connect/read timeouts and a bounded redirect policy.
- **All three Docker images build again** (builder pins behind the workspace MSRV, stale
  dummy-rlib relinking, missing `[[bench]]`/`[[test]]` stubs, `pkg-config`/`libssl-dev`
  for `openssl-sys`, and base images too old for ort's prebuilt onnxruntime). Cargo
  invocations now run `--locked`.

### Security

- **Audio sample-rate DoS bounded** — a hostile WAV header can no longer drive an
  unbounded allocation; the decode sample budget is clamped to a fixed ceiling.
- **FFI use-after-free guarded** — the C-ABI hot paths reject already-disposed handles
  and use acquire/release ordering on the dispose flag.

## [2.0.14] - 2026-06-11

### Fixed

- **CoreML EP no longer fails at runtime on the GigaAM Conformer encoder
  (issue #42).** CoreML cannot execute partitions compiled with dynamic
  shapes — every prediction failed with `error code: -1` regardless of
  compute units or model format. The EP is now configured with
  `RequireStaticInputShapes` + `MLProgram`: heavy conv/matmul blocks run on
  the Neural Engine, dynamic-shape ops stay on CPU. Measured ~3x faster
  encoder inference on a 4 s WAV and ~5.6x on a 2-minute file vs the
  pure-CPU build (M1 Pro, INT8, release).

### Added

- **`Engine::warmup()` + automatic CoreML→CPU runtime fallback.**
  `Engine::load` now probes CoreML with ~1 s of silence and transparently
  rebuilds all sessions on the CPU EP if the probe fails (covers both
  session-load and first-`Run()` failures), logging
  `falling back to CPU execution provider` instead of crashing. The server
  warms every pooled session triplet before `axum::serve` accepts traffic,
  removing the first-request cold start.
- **CoreML runtime smoke in CI** (`build-coreml`, macos-14, main push only):
  transcribes `golos_00.wav` with the release binary and fails on inference
  error, missing reference text, or silent CPU fallback.
- **Full cross-ASR benchmark on 9 994 Golos crowd samples.**
  - Vosk: 4.27% WER / 0.107x RTF (1.3 GB)
  - gigastt: 11.37% WER / 0.335x RTF (230 MB)
  - whisper.cpp: 14.96% WER / 1.108x RTF (~3 GB)
  - faster-whisper: 15.73% WER / 1.224x RTF (~3 GB)
  - Results published on `benchmark-results-local` branch with shield.io badges.
  - Added sequential runner script and monitor for long-running benchmarks.

## [2.0.13] - 2026-06-08

### Dependencies

- **prost** 0.14.3 → 0.14.4
- **prost-build** 0.14.3 → 0.14.4
- **polyvoice** 0.6.7 → 0.6.8

### CI

- **actions/cache** 4 → 5
- **codecov/codecov-action** 4 → 7

## [2.0.12] - 2026-06-03

### Added

- **CI coverage expanded to 90 %+.**
  - `coverage-e2e` job now runs ignored lib+bin unit tests (model-dependent)
    alongside integration tests, merging all coverage into a single Cobertura
    report.
  - CLI command coverage: `--help`, `serve --help`, `download`, `quantize --force`,
    and `transcribe` are exercised via `cargo llvm-cov run` to cover the `main()`
    command-dispatch paths.
  - New E2E WebSocket tests: unrecognized text message (`Ok(_) => Continue`),
    client Close frame handling, and max-session pre-check branch.
  - New unit tests for `build_limits` with valid/invalid TOML config files.

### Changed

- `.gitignore` now also ignores `lcov-*.info` and `lcov-*.xml` (local coverage
  merge artifacts).

## [2.0.11] - 2026-06-01

### Added

- **Comprehensive unit-test coverage expansion across all crates.**
  - `gigastt-core` — pool blocking checkout paths, ONNX error wrapping,
    engine load failure modes, feature-extractor defaults, tokenizer edge
    cases (empty lines, bare integers, no-whitespace fallback), quantizer
    end-to-end matmul and shared-weight paths.
  - `gigastt` — HTTP handler unit tests for readiness (shutdown, pool
    exhaustion, metrics), transcribe (payload too large, pool closed, invalid
    audio), SSE stream (payload too large, pool closed), JSON serialization
    fallback, server startup/shutdown, runtime-limit clamping, origin and
    request-id middleware integration.
  - `gigastt-ffi` — null-engine guards, invalid-UTF8 paths, path traversal
    rejection, `stream_new`/`process_chunk`/`flush` round-trip, idempotent
    quantize, `string_free_null` safety.
  - E2E tests refined: deduplicated shared helpers, cleaner shutdown
    sequencing, expanded rate-limit and error-path coverage.
- **`__internals` required feature for `tokenizer` benchmark.** Prevents
  `cargo clippy --all-targets` from failing on the private tokenizer module.

### Fixed

- Flaky `test_readiness_with_metrics` caused by shared engine singleton
  contention (pool size 1). Switched to isolated `fresh_engine()` per test.

## [2.0.10] - 2026-05-31

### Changed

- **rubato 0.16 → 3.0** — migrated resampling (`resample` / `resample_with_cache`)
  for the breaking 3.0 API: `SincFixedIn` replaced by `Async::new_sinc` with
  `FixedAsync::Input`, and the new `audioadapter` buffer model
  (`SequentialSliceOfVecs`). Behaviour-preserving (same sinc parameters).
- **polyvoice 0.5 → 0.6.7** — migrated speaker diarization for the new 0.6 API:
  `OfflineDiarizer` / `OnlineDiarizer` replaced by `Pipeline` / `StreamingPipeline`
  that take an explicit `EnergyVad`. The `EmbeddingExtractor` is now owned per
  pipeline, so the shared ONNX speaker encoder is wrapped in `Arc` behind a
  `SharedExtractor` adapter and cloned into each session. `DiarizationConfig`
  flat fields moved under nested `ClusterConfig` / `VadConfig` (streaming
  clustering threshold pinned to 0.5).
- **toml 0.9 → 1.1** — TOML config parsing update.
- **dashmap 6.1 → 6.2** — concurrent map update (per-IP rate limiter).
- **serde_json 1.0.149 → 1.0.150** — JSON serialization patch update.

## [2.0.9] - 2026-05-24

### Changed

- **symphonia 0.5 → 0.6** — migrated audio decoding (`decode_audio_inner`) for
  breaking changes in Symphonia 0.6.0: `SampleBuffer` replaced with
  `GenericAudioBufferRef` copy methods, `next_packet()` now returns `Ok(None)` on
  EOF, `default_track()` requires `TrackType::Audio`, `CodecParameters` is now an
  enum with audio params accessed via `.audio()`.
- **thiserror 1.0 → 2.0** — error derive macro update.
- **toml 0.8 → 1.1** — TOML config file parsing update.
- **tokio 1.52.2 → 1.52.3** — async runtime patch update.
- **cbindgen 0.28 → 0.29** — FFI header generation build-dependency update.
- **codecov-action 5 → 6** — CI coverage action update.

## [2.0.8] - 2026-05-07

### Changed

- **WER benchmark expanded to full Golos crowd dataset** — `benchmark.rs` now
  reads from `~/.gigastt/benchmarks/golos_wav/manifest.json` (9 994 samples) and
  falls back to the bundled 15-file smoke test when the external set is missing.
  Full run: **11.4% WER** (5 729 errors / 50 394 words, 95% bootstrap CI
  [10.9%, 11.9%]) on Apple M1 CPU (~105 min).  Added bootstrap confidence
  intervals, progress reporting every 50 samples, and `translit_anglicisms`
  normalization for loanwords (`tv` → `тв`, `synergy` → `синергия`, etc.).

## [2.0.7] - 2026-05-08

### Fixed

- **PCM16 carry byte loss** — `parse_pcm16_with_carry_into` no longer drops the
  last byte of an odd-length chunk when no carry is pending. The previous
  tuple-pattern loop `while let (Some(b0), Some(b1))` consumed the trailing byte
  into `b0` and then discarded it when `b1` was `None`.

### Added

- **Pre-commit hook** — `.githooks/pre-commit` enforces `fmt`, `clippy`, and
  `cargo test --workspace` before every commit.
- **Makefile** — `make check` runs the full local validation suite;
  `make fix` auto-formats and applies clippy suggestions.

### Changed

- **AGENTS.md** — documents hook setup and required GitHub branch protection
  rules to prevent broken code from reaching `main`.

## [2.0.6] - 2026-05-08

### Security / Reliability

- **Pool slot leak on cancelled checkout** — `PoolInner::checkin` now retries dead
  waiters instead of silently dropping the item when a `checkout` future is
  cancelled (timeout, `select!`, or abort).  Three new unit tests verify the fix.
- **SIGTERM handling** — the server now traps `SIGTERM` on Unix in addition to
  `SIGINT`, enabling graceful shutdown in Docker and Kubernetes environments.
- **FFI panic safety** — `gigastt_transcribe_file` wraps inference in
  `catch_unwind`, preventing undefined behavior when an ONNX panic crosses the
  C ABI boundary.
- **FFI path traversal via symlinks** — `gigastt_transcribe_file` now resolves
  symlinks with `canonicalize()` before the working-directory boundary check,
  blocking symlink attacks that escape the sandbox.
- **Tokenizer blank-id underflow** — `Tokenizer::load` guards against empty
  vocabularies and uses `saturating_sub` instead of `tokens.len() - 1`,
  eliminating a subtraction underflow on corrupted `vocab.txt`.
- **SIGHUP registration failure** — replaces `expect()` with graceful degradation;
  the server no longer aborts when signal fds are exhausted in containers.
- **Decode loop panic surface** — replaces `unwrap()` in the RNN-T greedy decode
  blank-run cache with `anyhow::bail!` and `expect` with clear messages.
- **Resampler cache invariant** — replaces `unreachable!()` in
  `resample_with_cache` with `anyhow::bail!`, and surfaces resampler failures
  instead of silently returning empty output.

### Protocol / API

- **WebSocket idle timeout Close frame** — idle timeouts now emit a
  `ServerMessage::Error` with code `"idle_timeout"` followed by `Close(1001)`,
  making the reason distinguishable from a network partition.
- **WebSocket empty-frame spam Close frame** — exceeding
  `MAX_EMPTY_FRAMES_PER_SESSION` now sends `Error` + `Close(1008)` before
  dropping the connection.
- **CORS preflight for all protected routes** — `OPTIONS` handlers added to
  `/v1/models`, `/v1/ws`, and `/metrics` so browser preflight requests no
  longer receive 405.
- **Rate limiter `Retry-After`** — header is now computed from the actual refill
  interval instead of the hard-coded `60` seconds.  The 429 JSON body now
  includes `retry_after_ms` for consistency with the 503 pool-saturation response.
- **SSE final segment on shutdown** — the SSE streaming task always flushes a
  final segment (even during shutdown), matching WebSocket behavior.

### Concurrency / Reliability

- **Pool lost-wakeup race** — `checkout` and `checkout_blocking` now re-check
  the `items` queue under the `waiters` lock before registering a waiter,
  closing the race where a concurrent `checkin` could return an item to the
  pool while the caller needlessly sleeps.
- **Rate limiter O(n) eviction** — replaced the global `iter().min_by_key()`
  scan with a bounded 100-entry sample, eliminating the DoS vector where an
  attacker fills the map and forces a 100 k-entry scan on every new IP.

### Performance

- **Eliminated encoder output copy** — `run_inference` passes the encoder
  tensor borrow directly to `greedy_decode` instead of `to_vec()`-copying it.
  Saves ~1–4 MB of transient allocation per chunk (scales with audio duration).
- **Reusable mel-output buffer** — `StreamingState` now owns a `mel_output`
  `Vec<f32>` that is resized in-place by `compute_with_buffers`, removing one
  ~4–20 KB allocation per `process_chunk` call.
- **Metrics interning** — metric family names are now `Arc<str>` keys in the
  Prometheus registry, eliminating `String` allocation on every `counter_inc`,
  `gauge_set`, and `histogram_record`.  The public API accepts
  `&[(&str, &str)]` labels so callers no longer allocate `Vec<(String, String)>`
  on the hot path.
- **Flattened mel filterbank** — `MelSpectrogram.mel_filterbank` changed from
  `Vec<Vec<f32>>` to a contiguous `Vec<f32>` (row-major), improving cache
  locality during the per-frame mel dot-product and removing one
  pointer-indirection per bin.
- **Zero-copy audio buffer preparation** — `prepare_audio_buffer` now returns
  `Option<usize>` (usable sample count) instead of allocating a new `Vec<f32>`.
  The caller borrows `&buffer[..usable]` for feature extraction and then shifts
  leftovers in-place, removing one ~0.5–5 KB allocation per `process_chunk`.
- **Reusable PCM decode buffer** — new `parse_pcm16_with_carry_into` writes
  decoded f32 samples into a caller-provided `&mut Vec<f32>`. The WebSocket
  handler reuses a single buffer across binary frames, eliminating the per-frame
  `Vec<f32>` allocation from PCM16 decoding.
- **Resampler zero-alloc path** — `resample_with_cache` now sanitizes non-finite
  samples in-place (no extra `Vec`), takes owned input, and writes output into a
  reusable buffer via `process_into_buffer`, removing rubato's internal output
  allocation on every resampling call.

### Fixed

- **Dependency version mismatch** — `gigastt/Cargo.toml` and
  `gigastt-ffi/Cargo.toml` now specify `gigastt-core = "2.0.5"` instead of the
  stale `"2.0.2"`.
- **ONNX cache dir creation error swallowed** — `create_dir_all` failure now
  propagates with context instead of being silently ignored.
- **Pre-epoch clock warning** — `now_timestamp()` logs a `warn!` when the
  system clock is before Unix epoch instead of silently returning `0.0`.
- **`libc::flock` safety comment** — added `// SAFETY:` documentation for the
  only `unsafe` block outside the FFI crate.
- **AGENTS.md updated** — removed stale `/ws` alias references and documented
  the `nnapi` execution-provider feature.

## [2.0.5] - 2026-05-07

### Fixed

- **Model download lock file** — `ensure_model` now creates the target directory
  *before* acquiring the advisory `flock`, preventing a "No such file or directory"
  error when `~/.gigastt/models` does not yet exist (regression in v2.0.4).

## [2.0.4] - 2026-05-07

### Security / Reliability

- **Pool lock poisoning eliminated** — replaced `std::sync::Mutex` with `parking_lot::Mutex` in `PoolInner`. A panic in any inference thread no longer poisons the mutex and permanently disables the pool.
- **Pool session leak fixed** — `OwnedReservation` now owns the `SessionTriplet` and implements `Drop`, guaranteeing the slot is returned even when `spawn_blocking` panics or is cancelled.
- **Rate limiter memory cap** — `DashMap` now has a hard limit of 100 000 buckets. Oldest entries are evicted when the cap is hit, preventing unbounded growth under rotating-IP botnets.
- **WS empty-frame spam protection** — connections are closed after 1 000 empty binary frames to prevent CPU/queue exhaustion.
- **Model download TOCTOU fixed** — `ensure_model` uses advisory `flock()` and unique `.partial` filenames so concurrent processes cannot corrupt partial downloads.
- **CLI validation** — `--rate-limit-burst 0` with `--rate-limit-per-minute > 0` is now rejected at startup.
- **SSE keep-alive** — explicit 15-second heartbeat comments keep proxies (nginx, ALB) from silently closing idle streams.
- **Metrics lock poisoning fixed** — `std::sync::RwLock` replaced with `parking_lot::RwLock` in the Prometheus registry.
- **Distributed tracing spans** — `tracing::Span::current()` is propagated across `spawn_blocking` boundaries so the full request path (pool wait → inference → output) is traceable.

### Added

- New Prometheus gauge `gigastt_pool_waiters` exposing the number of tasks blocked on pool checkout.
- Unit tests for `OwnedReservation` panic recovery and `Option<OwnedReservation>` round-trips.

## [2.0.3] - 2026-05-07

### Fixed

- **Documentation sync** — updated Russian README, AGENTS.md, CHANGELOG,
  SECURITY.md, OpenAPI spec, release verification docs, and production-readiness
  spec to reflect the v2.0 workspace split accurately.

## [2.0.2] - 2026-05-07

### Added

- **`crates/gigastt-core/README.md`** — dedicated README for the `gigastt-core`
  crate on crates.io.

## [2.0.1] - 2026-05-07

### Fixed

- **crates.io publishing** — added `readme` path to all crate manifests for
  proper crates.io display.
- **Path dependency versions** — added explicit versions to `gigastt-core` path
  dependencies for crates.io publish compatibility.
- **Workspace README** — updated top-level README for the workspace split.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-05-07

### Changed

- **Workspace split** — monolith refactored into a 3-crate Cargo workspace:
  - `gigastt-core` — inference engine, model download, quantization, audio
    decoding (library crate)
  - `gigastt-ffi` — C-ABI bindings for Android (cdylib)
  - `gigastt` — CLI + axum server (binary crate)
  This enables embedding `gigastt-core` as a standalone library in other Rust
  projects.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-05-06

### Changed

- **polyvoice** dependency bumped from `0.4.3` to `0.5.2` (VAD, AHC
  clustering, DER evaluation, CLI tooling; no API changes for gigastt).

## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-06

First stable release. All P0 blockers and P1 ship-before-v1.0 items from the
production-readiness review are closed. Public API (REST, WebSocket, CLI) is
now covered by semver guarantees.

### Added

- **Configurable pool checkout timeout** — `--pool-checkout-timeout-secs`
  (env `GIGASTT_POOL_CHECKOUT_TIMEOUT_SECS`, default 30). `Retry-After`
  headers and `retry_after_ms` JSON fields derive from the same value.
- **WebSocket protocol version negotiation** — `Configure` accepts an
  optional `protocol_version` field; the server rejects unsupported versions
  with error code `unsupported_protocol_version`. `Ready` includes
  `min_protocol_version` for client-side discovery.
- **Extended Prometheus metrics** — `gigastt_pool_available` (gauge),
  `gigastt_pool_checkout_duration_seconds` (histogram),
  `gigastt_pool_timeouts_total` (counter), `gigastt_ws_active_connections`
  (gauge), `gigastt_inference_duration_seconds` (histogram),
  `gigastt_rate_limit_rejections_total` (counter).
- **`SECURITY.md`** — responsible disclosure policy (90-day timeline).
- **`docs/privacy.md`** — auditable privacy-first claim documentation.
- **`docs/observability/`** — example Prometheus alerting rules and a
  starter Grafana dashboard JSON.
- **`cargo-semver-checks`** in CI — catches accidental breaking changes on PRs.
- **`cargo-tarpaulin`** coverage job — uploads to Codecov on main push.

### Changed

- **Idle timeout e2e test** uses a 3 s server-side timeout instead of the
  default 300 s, reducing wall-clock from ~310 s to ~5 s.

### Removed

- **`POOL_RETRY_AFTER_MS` / `POOL_RETRY_AFTER_SECS` constants** — replaced
  by functions that derive the hint from `pool_checkout_timeout_secs`.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-05-05

Speaker diarization is now a default feature powered by the polyvoice crate
from crates.io. Breaking CLI change: `--diarization` replaced by `--skip-diarization`.

### Changed

- **Diarization default feature** — `diarization` added to default Cargo features;
  speaker model downloads automatically with `gigastt download`.
- **polyvoice from crates.io** — replaced local path dependency (`../polyvoice`)
  with published `polyvoice = "0.4.3"` from crates.io.
- **CLI flag renamed** — `gigastt download --diarization` replaced by
  `gigastt download --skip-diarization` (opt-out instead of opt-in).
- **API adaptation** — `DiarizationConfig` uses `SampleRate` wrapper type and
  explicit `max_gap_secs` field to match polyvoice 0.4.3 API.

### Removed

- **In-tree diarization module** (`src/inference/diarization.rs`) — `SpeakerEncoder`,
  `SpeakerCluster`, and `cosine_similarity` replaced by polyvoice's
  `OnnxEmbeddingExtractor`, `OnlineDiarizer`, and `OfflineDiarizer`.

### Fixed

- Duplicate `tokens.is_empty()` guard in `tokens_to_words`.
- Stale `diarization.rs` references in CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md.
- Magic numbers in `OnnxEmbeddingExtractor::new()` extracted to named constants.
- `text` assembly in `transcribe_samples` moved after diarization annotation.

## [0.9.6] - 2026-05-04

Performance, security, and DX improvements. Internal refactor with no breaking
changes to the REST, WebSocket, or CLI public APIs.

### Added

- **OpenAPI REST spec** (`docs/openapi.yaml`) — documents `/health`, `/v1/models`,
  `/v1/transcribe`, `/v1/transcribe/stream`, and `/metrics` endpoints.
- **Reusable inference buffers** — mel spectrogram FFT/power buffers cached in
  `StreamingState`; joiner logits buffer reused across decode steps. Reduces
  per-chunk allocations by ~60 % in the streaming hot path.
- **Zero-allocation token cleaning** — `tokens_to_words` no longer allocates a
  temporary `String` for every BPE token.
- **`FeatureExtractor`** and **`TranscriptAssembler`** — extracted from `Engine`
  to reduce god-object surface area. `Engine` now coordinates loading and inference
  while sub-components own signal processing and transcript assembly.
- **CORS preflight (`OPTIONS`) routes** and `Vary: Origin` header — compliant
  with CORS complex-request requirements.
- **Per-IP rate limiter trust-proxy toggle** — `extract_client_ip` no longer
  reads `X-Forwarded-For` unless explicitly trusted, closing the IP-spoofing
  vector for deployments behind reverse proxies.
- **CPU EP thread limits** — `intra_threads(1)` + `inter_threads(1)` for the
  CPU execution provider, preventing ORT thread oversubscription on multi-core
  hosts.
- **Cached resampler** (`resample_with_cache`) — `SincFixedIn` instance reused
  across WebSocket chunks for the same connection.
- **WER gate in benchmark suite** — `tests/benchmark.rs` asserts `wer < 12.0`
  so regressions fail CI.
- **E2E zero-port testing** — `run_with_config_listener` accepts a pre-bound
  `TcpListener`, eliminating the TOCTOU race in `tests/common/mod.rs`.

### Changed

- **WebSocket examples** (`examples/*`) migrated to canonical `/v1/ws` path,
  added `ready`-wait and explicit `stop` signal.
- **`GigasttError`** refactored from string-based enum to `thiserror` struct
  variants with typed `source` chains. Improves programmatic error handling
  and preserves causal chains across the FFI boundary.
- **PII sanitization** — inference logs now emit token/word counts and audio
  duration instead of raw transcript text.

### Fixed

- **Pool deadlock** — reverted `Pool<T>` back to `async-channel` (the partial
  `tokio::sync::mpsc` migration deadlocked `close()` vs `blocking_recv()`).
- **`soak.yml`** stdout redirect and artifact retention fixed.
- **CI** migrated to `nextest` for faster, more reliable unit-test runs.

## [0.9.5] - 2026-04-23

Production-hardening release: security fix, Android FFI support, and lean builds.

### Security

- **RUSTSEC-2026-0104** — `rustls-webpki` 0.103.12 → 0.103.13. Reachable panic in CRL parsing fixed.

### Added

- **Android FFI layer** (`src/ffi.rs`, feature `ffi`). C-ABI exports:
  `gigastt_engine_new`, `gigastt_engine_new_with_pool_size`,
  `gigastt_transcribe_file`, `gigastt_stream_new`,
  `gigastt_stream_process_chunk`, `gigastt_stream_flush`,
  `gigastt_stream_free`, `gigastt_string_free`, `gigastt_engine_free`.
  Enables embedding gigastt as `libgigastt.so` in Android apps.
- **`ort/nnapi`** via feature `ffi` — Android NPU/DSP acceleration when available.
- **`Pool::checkout_blocking()`** — synchronous pool checkout for FFI callers.
- **`Serialize` derive on `TranscriptSegment`** — JSON serialization for FFI streaming.
- **Android default pool size = 1** — reduces mobile RSS from ~560 MB to ~350 MB.
- **`server` Cargo feature** (enabled by default) — gates `axum`, `tokio-stream`,
  `tokio-util`. Building `--no-default-features --features ffi` strips server
  dead code from mobile `.so` binaries.
- **Binary target** (`gigastt` bin) requires `server` feature via
  `required-features` in `Cargo.toml`.
- **Android CI workflow** (`.github/workflows/android.yml`) — builds
  `libgigastt.so` for `arm64-v8a` on every PR/push.

### Changed

- **README refactor** — added terminal demo block, Troubleshooting section,
  HTTP error codes table, extracted full CLI reference to `docs/cli.md`,
  fixed "unlimited concurrent" comparison, added Contributing link.

### Fixed

- Clippy warnings: `clippy::single_match`, `clippy::items_after_test_module`,
  `clippy::manual_is_multiple_of`.

## [0.9.4] - 2026-04-21

Dependency-bump rollup. No functional source changes; every entry here is
a Dependabot PR that landed green on the polish-green main from 0.9.3.

### Dependencies

- `reqwest` 0.12.28 → 0.13.2 (new TLS backend pulls `aws-lc-rs`).
- `prost-build` 0.13.5 → 0.14.3 (`petgraph` 0.7 → 0.8 transitively).
- `axum` 0.8.8 → 0.8.9 + `tokio-tungstenite` 0.28 → 0.29 in dev-deps
  (wire-protocol unchanged).
- `tokio`-ecosystem group bump (tokio + tokio-* minors).

### CI / workflow actions

- `actions/checkout` 4 → 6 across ci.yml, release.yml, soak.yml, homebrew.yml.
- `actions/upload-artifact` 4 → 7 in release.yml, soak.yml.
- `actions/attest-build-provenance` 3 → 4 in release.yml.
- `softprops/action-gh-release` 2 → 3 in release.yml.

### Not landed

- `rubato` 0.16 → 2.0 (Dependabot PR #9) closed: the 2.0 release removes
  `SincFixedIn` in favour of a new `audioadapter` API; migrating
  `src/inference/audio.rs::resample` is a code change Dependabot can't
  generate automatically. Pinned at 0.16.2 until someone ports the
  resampler.

## [0.9.3] - 2026-04-21

Polish-before-production release. No functional behaviour changes for existing
clients; server, CLI, REST, and WebSocket surfaces are wire-compatible with
v0.9.2. Dockerfile was broken since v0.9.0 — this release fixes it.

### Fixed

- **Docker images now actually build** (`Dockerfile`, `Dockerfile.cuda`). Both
  builders gained `protobuf-compiler` (required by `build.rs` since v0.9.0's
  `prost-build` migration) and now `COPY proto/` + `build.rs` before `src/`.
  The 0.9.0 / 0.9.1 / 0.9.2 images failed at `cargo build` with
  `prost-build failed to compile proto/onnx.proto`; the published Docker
  recipes in README only worked if the reader had protoc in their base image.
- **`tests/e2e_rest.rs::test_rest_large_body_rss_within_budget` removed.** The
  test asserted `RSS_after - RSS_before < wav.len() * 3 + 40 MiB` after
  POSTing a 300 s WAV. Every main-push CI run since v0.9.0 observed a delta
  of ~320 MiB regardless of whether the REST upload path was zero-copy or
  4×-copy, because ONNX Runtime's encoder scratch for 5 minutes of 16 kHz
  audio allocates ~90+ MiB by itself. The test could neither catch the
  zero-copy regression it was designed for nor pass reliably. The zero-copy
  contract is covered by the `BytesMediaSource` impl in
  `src/inference/audio.rs` and the unit tests around it.
- **`src/inference/tokenizer.rs`**: skip vocab lines that parse as a bare
  integer (e.g. a legacy `1025\n` size header). Such a line has no trailing
  id column, so the existing `rfind([' ', '\t'])` fallback would push the
  integer string as a ghost token and poison the ID space.
- **`src/server/metrics.rs::fmt_f64_prom`**: drop the empty-body
  `if v == v.trunc() && v.abs() < 1e15 { }` branch that existed only to
  document that it was a no-op. The `format!("{v}")` tail always ran.

### Changed

- **`Engine::transcribe_file` / `transcribe_bytes_shared` share a
  `transcribe_samples(&[f32], &mut SessionTriplet)` tail.** Previously the
  two bodies duplicated the mel → encoder → decode → word-join sequence
  byte-for-byte. Same public API, same behaviour, one implementation.
- **`src/server/mod.rs`**: `MAX_RPM` clamp + warn moved into
  `RateLimiter::new`; the startup log line calls `limiter.interval_ms()`
  instead of duplicating the math. Dropped the write-only
  `RateLimiter::last_evict_ms` field — eviction already runs on a tokio
  interval, nothing read the stored timestamp. Exposed the public
  constant `server::rate_limit::MAX_RPM` (= 60 000) for external callers.
- **`src/server/mod.rs`**: single source of truth for `SUPPORTED_RATES`
  (`pub(crate)`). The REST `/v1/models` handler used to inline
  `vec![8000, 16000, 24000, 44100, 48000]` — it now reuses the same
  const the WS `Ready` payload reads.
- **`src/server/http.rs`**: `vocab_size` in `/v1/models` comes from
  `engine.vocab_size()` (new public `Engine::vocab_size()`), not a `1025`
  literal. If the upstream model rev ever resizes its BPE vocabulary the
  REST surface no longer lies.
- **`src/model/mod.rs`**: extracted `stream_to_partial_then_finalize(url,
  final_dest, expected_sha256, label)`. The per-file GigaAM download
  loop and the single-file speaker-diarization download now share one
  implementation of URL fetch, progress, stream-to-partial, and
  SHA-256 + atomic-rename finalize. Drops ~50 duplicated lines.
- **`src/quantize.rs`**: staging file suffix switched from `.onnx.tmp` to
  `.partial` so the in-tree INT8 quantizer uses the same convention as
  the HuggingFace download pipeline in `src/model/mod.rs`.
- **`tests/server_integration.rs` removed** (367 LoC, 6 tests). Every case
  is covered by the v0.4.3+ `tests/e2e_ws.rs` / `tests/e2e_rest.rs` /
  `tests/load_test.rs` suites; the legacy file used `sleep(200ms)` race
  gates and the long-deprecated `server::run(engine, port, host)`
  signature.
- **Deprecation headers on `/ws`**: the upgrade response now carries
  RFC 8594 `Deprecation: true` plus `Link: </v1/ws>; rel="successor-version"`
  so client libraries can surface the migration warning before v1.0
  drops the alias. Server-side warn log was already in place.
- **Docs + specs housekeeping:**
  - `specs/design-v1.0-{pool-and-rate-limit,rest-streaming,ws-lifecycle}.md`
    → `specs/archive/design-v1.0/` (all three shipped in v0.9.0-rc.1).
  - `docs/superpowers/` (v0.4 pre-ship plans) → `docs/archive/superpowers-v0.4/`.
  - `missions/gigastt-wer/` scratchpad deleted.
  - `specs/prod-readiness-v1.0.md` now carries a v0.9.0 rollup banner
    listing the closed IDs; detail rows left for historical trail.
  - `README_RU.md` synced to English README (`/v1/ws`, `/metrics` row,
    `125 unit tests`, INT8 section rewritten for the no-feature-flag
    behaviour shipped in v0.9.0).
  - `docs/deployment.md` rate-limiter version string corrected
    (v0.8.0, not v0.7.3).
  - `CLAUDE.md` drops references to the now-deleted
    `tests/server_integration.rs`.

### CI

- **`cargo audit` job** switched from `cargo install cargo-audit --locked`
  (rebuilt on every PR, ~90 s) to the prebuilt `rustsec/audit-check@v2`
  action — same checker, same advisory source.
- **`soak.yml` cache key** scoped by profile (`-release`) so nightly soak
  runs don't evict the `target/` that `ci.yml` populates.

### Dependencies

- Removed redundant `tracing-subscriber` entry from `[dev-dependencies]`
  (already declared in `[dependencies]`; cargo exposes it to integration
  tests automatically).

## [0.9.2] - 2026-04-21

### Fixed

- **CI: minisign signing step accepts password non-interactively** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`). v0.9.1 release job got through the build + SBOM + provenance steps but failed at `Sign tarballs + SHA256SUMS with minisign` because `rsign2 sign -W` interprets `-W` as "write signature" (not "password"), so the process still prompted for a passphrase and rejected the key with `Wrong password for that key`. Switched to the apt-installed `minisign` binary, which reads the passphrase on stdin when stdout is non-TTY — a well-supported CI pattern.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-04-21

### Fixed

- **CI: install `protoc` on every cargo-build job** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `.github/workflows/release.yml`, `.github/workflows/soak.yml`). v0.9.0 rollout failed in the release workflow because `prost-build` shells out to `protoc` and the GitHub-hosted `macos-14` + `ubuntu-latest` runners don't carry it. Every cargo-build-facing job now runs `arduino/setup-protoc@v3` right after `rust-toolchain`. No source change — the v0.9.0 binaries would have been bit-identical if the CI had succeeded; v0.9.1 is purely a rebuild.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-04-21

_Stable release promoting `0.9.0-rc.2` + the follow-up supply-chain
lockdown (vendored ONNX protobuf, in-tree token-bucket rate limiter,
in-tree Prometheus encoder, CycloneDX SBOM, SLSA provenance, minisign
release signing). See the [Unreleased] rows moved in below for the
full rollup; no functional regressions since rc.2._


### Added

- **Vendored ONNX protobuf schema + native codegen** (`proto/onnx.proto`, `build.rs`, `src/onnx_proto.rs`). `proto/onnx.proto` is copied verbatim from github.com/onnx/onnx (MIT-licensed, 1 000 LoC) and regenerated on every build by `prost-build 0.13` — replacing the unmaintained `onnx-pb 0.1.4` crate (last published 2020, transitively pinned to `prost 0.6`). Requires `protoc` in `PATH` at build time (`brew install protobuf`, `apt install protobuf-compiler`); see `build.rs` for the friendly failure message. Closes `RUSTSEC-2021-0073`: the advisory targeted `prost-types 0.6`'s `From<Timestamp> for SystemTime` path, which no longer ships in our dependency graph — the ignore block is gone from `deny.toml` and `.cargo/audit.toml`.
- **Custom Prometheus text encoder** (`src/server/metrics.rs`, replaces `metrics-exporter-prometheus`). ~280-line `MetricsRegistry` that serialises counters + histograms in Prometheus 0.0.4 exposition format. We only expose two metrics (`gigastt_http_requests_total`, `gigastt_http_request_duration_seconds`), so a full Recorder-trait registry was overkill — the new `HttpMetricsMiddleware` calls `registry.counter_inc(...)` / `registry.histogram_record(...)` directly, no global recorder, no `metrics` / `metrics-util` / `indexmap` / `quanta` transitives. 125 lib tests pass (+ 7 new metrics tests covering counter increment, histogram bucket cumulativity, label ordering, label escaping, empty labels, sum tracking, and empty-registry rendering).
- **Nightly soak + load CI**. New `.github/workflows/soak.yml` runs `cargo test --test soak_test -- --ignored` at 03:17 UTC daily (plus `workflow_dispatch` for on-demand checks), reusing the main-CI model cache so regressions in pool drift / descriptor leaks / RSS growth surface outside the fast-feedback envelope.
- **`docs/deployment.md`: rate-limiter & X-Forwarded-For section**. The published nginx recipe used `$proxy_add_x_forwarded_for`, which appends client-supplied headers, and the Caddy recipe did not forward the real peer at all — operators who turned on `--rate-limit-per-minute` were running a defence attackers could trivially bypass. Both recipes now overwrite the header with `$remote_addr` / `{remote_host}`, and a new section explains why it's not optional.

### Changed

- **Custom per-IP token-bucket rate limiter (drops `tower_governor`)** (`src/server/rate_limit.rs`, `src/server/mod.rs`, `Cargo.toml`). Replaced the `tower_governor = "0.7"` dependency with a focused ~150-line implementation tailored to gigastt's single middleware hook. Drops `tower_governor`, `governor`, `forwarded-header-value`, and `nonzero_ext` from `Cargo.lock`; `dashmap` is promoted from transitive to direct so the lock-free shard map stays explicit. Refill math preserves the per-IP refill formula (`refill_per_ms = rpm / 60_000`) — covered by both the existing `test_rate_limit_interval_formula` and the new `test_rate_limiter_refill_formula_matches_v1_06`. IP extraction still honours the X-Forwarded-For trust boundary (first hop of `X-Forwarded-For`, then `X-Real-IP`, then `ConnectInfo`). Memory is bounded by a `tokio::spawn` eviction task that tracks `shutdown_root`, not the old `std::thread::spawn` GC thread that leaked on shutdown.
- **`Engine::create_state` accepts `diarization_enabled` unconditionally** (`src/inference/mod.rs`). The parameter used to be gated behind `#[cfg(feature = "diarization")]`, so the same public API mutated between feature builds — `src/lib.rs`'s doctest compiled only with `--features diarization`, and external consumers had to wrap every call site in their own gate. The bool is now always present; without the feature a `warn!` is emitted if the caller asked for diarization so the contract mismatch stays observable.
- **INT8 quantization is now always available and auto-invoked** (`src/main.rs`, `src/quantize.rs`, `src/lib.rs`, `Cargo.toml`). The native Rust quantization pipeline no longer hides behind the `quantize` Cargo feature — `onnx-pb` and `prost` are now unconditional dependencies and `pub mod quantize` is always compiled in. `gigastt download` and `gigastt serve` both call `ensure_int8_encoder` after `model::ensure_model`, producing the `v3_e2e_rnnt_encoder_int8.onnx` artifact on first run (~2 min one-time). The `quantize` feature is retained as a documented no-op so existing `cargo install gigastt --features quantize` invocations keep working.
- **New `--skip-quantize` flag on `serve` and `download`** (env `GIGASTT_SKIP_QUANTIZE=1`, default off). Opt out of the automatic quantization step when debugging against the FP32 encoder.

### Fixed

- **Model download TOCTOU** (`src/model/mod.rs`). `download_file` used to stream each `v3_e2e_rnnt_*.onnx` blob directly into its final path, compute SHA-256 afterwards, and `remove_file` on mismatch. Between the last `write` and the hash comparison another process (or a second `ensure_model` call on restart) could observe an unverified file under the canonical name — and a crash in that window left a corrupt artefact that `model_files_exist()` would later accept, skipping re-download on next boot. Downloads now stream into `<filename>.partial`, SHA-256 is computed against the partial, and only after verification does `std::fs::rename` (atomic on the same filesystem) promote it to the final path. Mismatch or crash leaves nothing under the final name. Stale `.partial` files from previous crashed runs are deleted before the new download begins.
- **Speaker diarization model lacked SHA-256 verification** (`src/model/mod.rs`, `--features diarization`). `ensure_speaker_model` streamed `wespeaker_resnet34.onnx` (26 535 549 bytes, from `onnx-community/wespeaker-voxceleb-resnet34-LM`) straight to its final path with no integrity check, so a tampered mirror or corrupted redirect was loaded into `ort::Session` without complaint — the same failure class as the model download TOCTOU. The downloader now stages into `<name>.partial`, verifies SHA-256 against the new `SPEAKER_MODEL_SHA256 = "3955447b0499dc9e0a4541a895df08b03c69098eba4e56c02b5603e9f7f4fcbb"` constant (pinned to the 2026-04-20 HuggingFace copy), and only then atomically renames.
- **Odd-length PCM16 WebSocket frames corrupted subsequent frames** (`src/server/mod.rs`). `handle_binary_frame` called `chunks_exact(2)` directly, silently dropping a trailing odd byte whenever a client split their PCM16 stream on an odd boundary. The dropped byte put the following frame 1 sample out of phase with the audio decoded so far — subtle in the waveform, measurable in the inference output, hard to diagnose. A per-connection `pending_byte: Option<u8>` now carries the remainder across frames (prepended before the next `chunks_exact`, re-stashed if the combined length is again odd).
- **`tests/e2e_rest.rs::test_rest_large_body_rss_within_budget` was mis-sized**. The helper call `generate_wav(150, 16000)` produced a 4.6 MiB WAV but the test asserted `> 30 MiB` and panicked before running. Regenerated at `generate_wav(300, 16000)` (9.6 MiB) with a budget that now accounts for the PCM16 → f32 expansion (2× wav.len() + 40 MiB slack).
- **`deny.toml` / `.cargo/audit.toml` justification for `RUSTSEC-2021-0073`**. `onnx-pb` has no newer release on crates.io (0.1.4 is the only published version) and the closest modern replacement (`onnx-protobuf` on the `protobuf` crate family) is broken at its current release. The advisory stays ignored with a refreshed rationale documenting that the affected `From<Timestamp> for SystemTime` code path is unreachable from our quantization pipeline.

## [0.9.0-rc.2] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed

- **`test_rest_oversized_body_rejected` e2e assertion** (`tests/e2e_errors.rs`). The rc.1 assertion insisted on a JSON body with `code="payload_too_large"`, but `axum::DefaultBodyLimit` returns a plain-text 413 when `Content-Length` exceeds the cap — the middleware layer fires before the handler's defence-in-depth guard. The strict 413 status contract is unchanged; the JSON-body check is now conditional on the handler-layer guard being the one that fires. The rc.1 binaries are functionally correct.

## [0.9.0-rc.1] - 2026-04-20

_Release candidate for v0.9.0 — bundles five P0 fixes plus two supporting items (`PoolGuard` Drop, strict 413 assertion) from `specs/prod-readiness-v1.0.md`. RuntimeLimits gained two fields (`max_session_secs`, `shutdown_drain_secs`) — external callers constructing the struct literally must update their call sites. SessionPool checkout API replaced (`checkout() -> PoolGuard`)._

### Added

- **Graceful WebSocket / SSE drain on shutdown** (closes `specs/prod-readiness-v1.0.md` P0). `axum::serve.with_graceful_shutdown` only tracks the HTTP router — WebSocket upgrades and SSE `spawn_blocking` tasks used to outlive the signal, so clients lost their `Final` frame on deploy. New `CancellationToken` + `TaskTracker` cascade through every handler; on SIGTERM each live session flushes, emits an empty-if-needed `Final`, and closes with `Close(1001 Going Away)`. After `axum::serve` returns, `run_with_config` waits up to `shutdown_drain_secs` for the tracker to drain.
- **Wall-clock max-session cap** (closes `specs/prod-readiness-v1.0.md` P0). `idle_timeout` is reset on every frame, so a client that streams silence every 100 ms held a `SessionTriplet` forever. New `max_session_secs` limit closes the session with `Close(1008 Policy Violation)` + `Error { code: "max_session_duration_exceeded" }`. `0` disables the cap (not recommended).
- **CLI flags.**
  - `--max-session-secs` / `GIGASTT_MAX_SESSION_SECS` (default `3600`).
  - `--shutdown-drain-secs` / `GIGASTT_SHUTDOWN_DRAIN_SECS` (default `10`, clamped to `>= 1`).
- **`tests/e2e_shutdown.rs` re-enabled in CI** with four additional assertions: `test_shutdown_ws_emits_final_and_close`, `test_shutdown_sse_stream_terminates_cleanly`, `test_max_session_duration_cap`, and `test_shutdown_during_pool_saturation_returns_503_not_500`. The main-push e2e job now runs the full `--test e2e_rest --test e2e_ws --test e2e_errors --test e2e_shutdown` matrix.
- **`docs/runbook.md`** — rollback + on-call guidance for the new knobs.
- **`docs/deployment.md`** — `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` recommendation for k8s / docker-compose.

### Fixed

- **Per-IP rate-limiter math (`src/server/mod.rs`).** `(rate_limit_per_minute / 60).max(1)` truncated every value below 60 rpm to a 1 rps refill (= 60 rpm), so a defender setting `--rate-limit-per-minute 10` actually allowed 60 rpm — 6× weaker than declared. Switched to `tower_governor`'s `per_millisecond(60_000 / rpm)`, which preserves sub-second precision down to 1 rpm and clamps the upper bound at 60 000 rpm with a `warn!`. The startup log now includes the resolved `interval_ms` alongside `rpm` for diagnostics.
- **Session pool panic + unfairness (`src/inference/mod.rs`).** Replaced the `tokio::sync::mpsc::Receiver` behind a `tokio::sync::Mutex` with a lock-free `async_channel`. The new `Pool<T>` (alias `SessionPool = Pool<SessionTriplet>`) is FIFO under contention, exposes `close()` so graceful shutdown wakes every waiter with `PoolError::Closed` instead of panicking via `.expect("Pool sender dropped")`, and returns a `PoolGuard` whose `Drop` impl auto-checks-in the triplet on panic unwind. Server shutdown now wires `engine.pool.close()` into the shutdown future, and the REST handlers translate `PoolError::Closed` into a distinct 503 `pool_closed` response (separate from the 503 `timeout` for the 30 s checkout deadline).
- **REST oversized-body rejection is now strict 413** (`tests/e2e_errors.rs::test_rest_oversized_body_rejected`). Handlers in `src/server/http.rs` now add an explicit `body.len() > limits.body_limit_bytes → 413 payload_too_large` guard as defence-in-depth behind `DefaultBodyLimit`, and the e2e assertion upgrades from `!= 200` to a strict `== 413` with `code="payload_too_large"`.

### Changed

- `RuntimeLimits` gained `max_session_secs: u64` and `shutdown_drain_secs: u64`. External callers constructing `RuntimeLimits` literally will need to add the new fields (pre-1.0 minor bump — acceptable).
- `http::AppState` carries `shutdown: CancellationToken` and `tracker: TaskTracker`.
- `handle_ws_inner` switches from a bare `timeout(idle, source.next())` to a `biased;` `select!` with explicit cancel + deadline branches.
- `/v1/transcribe/stream` SSE task now runs on `TaskTracker::spawn_blocking` and polls the shutdown token between chunks so SIGTERM aborts long transcriptions instead of waiting them out.
- `SessionPool::{checkout, checkin, blocking_checkin}` replaced by `SessionPool::checkout() -> Result<PoolGuard, PoolError>`. The guard `Deref`s to `SessionTriplet` and auto-checks-in on drop. For `'static` consumers (`spawn_blocking`), call `guard.into_owned()` to get a `(SessionTriplet, OwnedReservation)` pair and return the triplet via `OwnedReservation::checkin(triplet)`.
- **Zero-copy REST upload decode path** (`src/inference/audio.rs`, `src/inference/mod.rs`, `src/server/http.rs`). The `/v1/transcribe` and `/v1/transcribe/stream` handlers used to call `body.to_vec()` on the incoming `axum::body::Bytes`, then `decode_audio_bytes` cloned that `Vec<u8>` into a `std::io::Cursor`, and symphonia decoded the PCM into another `Vec<f32>` — four concurrent copies of the upload were in RAM at peak. A 4× concurrent upload of a 10-minute WAV held ~1 GiB transiently and could OOM on a 1 GiB container. New path: `bytes::Bytes` flows end-to-end via a crate-private `BytesMediaSource` that implements `Read + Seek + MediaSource` directly on the refcounted buffer; new `decode_audio_bytes_shared(Bytes)` and `Engine::transcribe_bytes_shared(Bytes, _)` entry points. The legacy `decode_audio_bytes(&[u8])` / `Engine::transcribe_bytes(&[u8], _)` functions remain as thin shims (one `Bytes::copy_from_slice` for non-REST callers), so no public API breakage.
- **Incremental 10-minute duration cap** inside the decode loop. The check used to fire only after the full PCM buffer was assembled, so a malformed or hostile upload could still allocate hundreds of MiB before being rejected. Now each packet's samples are accumulated against a precomputed sample budget and the decoder bails out on the first packet that breaks the cap.

### Dependencies

- Promoted `tokio-util = { version = "0.7", features = ["rt"] }` from transitive to direct. Dev-deps gained `tracing-subscriber` so integration tests can surface server logs on failure.
- `async-channel = "2"` (transitive pieces — `concurrent-queue`, `event-listener` — were already in the graph).
- Added explicit `bytes = "1"` pin (previously transitive via `axum` / `tokio`) — makes the zero-copy contract between axum and symphonia visible in `Cargo.toml`.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed

- **CoreML / CUDA startup crash on macOS 26+ (`Unable to serialize model as it contains compiled nodes`)** — `src/inference/mod.rs` previously called `.with_optimized_model_path(...)` after registering the CoreML / CUDA execution providers. Those EPs replace parts of the graph with compiled nodes that cannot be re-serialized as ONNX, so ORT aborted session creation before the server could bind. Regression introduced in v0.5.0. The optimized-ONNX cache path is removed from both EP paths; the CoreML block keeps its dedicated `coreml_cache/` (compiled-model cache) and the CUDA EP keeps its internal caches. Cost: ~1–2 s additional cold start. Benefit: `gigastt serve --features coreml` works again on macOS 14+.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added

- **Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint** (closes `specs/todo.md` item 7). Enabled via `--metrics` (env `GIGASTT_METRICS=1`); off by default. Exposes
  - `gigastt_http_requests_total{method,path,status}` (counter)
  - `gigastt_http_request_duration_seconds{method,path}` (histogram).
  The endpoint sits behind the Origin allowlist and (when configured) the per-IP rate limiter. Recorder install is tolerant of double-install: emits a warning and keeps the server running instead of failing.
- **Per-IP rate limiting** (closes `specs/todo.md` item 17). `--rate-limit-per-minute N` (env `GIGASTT_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE`) + `--rate-limit-burst N` (env `GIGASTT_RATE_LIMIT_BURST`). Off by default. Applies to `/v1/*` and `/v1/ws`; `/health` is exempt. Implemented with `tower_governor` using `SmartIpKeyExtractor`. Returns 429 on violations. A background task evicts expired token buckets every 60 s.
- **`docs/deployment.md`** (closes `specs/todo.md` item 20). Reverse-proxy recipes for Caddy and nginx (certbot + `auth_basic`), Origin header behaviour, Docker binding strategy, health-check target, and a hardening checklist for remote deployments.

### Changed

- `ServerConfig` gained a `metrics_enabled: bool` field; `RuntimeLimits` gained `rate_limit_per_minute` + `rate_limit_burst`.
- `http::AppState` now carries `metrics_handle: Option<PrometheusHandle>`.
- The axum router splits into `/health` (public) and a `protected` sub-router for `/v1/*`, `/ws` alias, `/v1/ws`, and `/metrics` — rate limiter is layered on the protected branch only.

### Dependencies

- `tower_governor = "0.7"`
- `metrics = "0.24"`
- `metrics-exporter-prometheus = "0.17"` (default-features off)

## [0.7.2] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed

- **`cargo-deny` licenses + advisories** (`deny.toml`).
  - Added `CDLA-Permissive-2.0` to the license allowlist — `webpki-root-certs` (the Mozilla CA bundle) publishes under CDLA; behaves like MIT for our use.
  - Added `RUSTSEC-2021-0073` to `ignore` in `[advisories]`. `prost-types 0.6.1` is a build-time transitive of `onnx-pb` under the `quantize` feature; the affected `From<Timestamp> for SystemTime` path is not reached by our pipeline.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed

- **`cargo-deny` CI job** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) — removed the trailing `arguments: licenses advisories bans sources`. The installed `cargo-deny` on stable-musl interpreted them as subcommands and failed with `unrecognized subcommand 'licenses'`. Default `check` already covers licenses, advisories, bans, and sources.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added

- **Configurable runtime limits** (`gigastt::server::RuntimeLimits`, closes `specs/todo.md` item 6). Three knobs exposed via CLI + environment variables:
  - `--idle-timeout-secs` / `GIGASTT_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECS` — WebSocket idle timeout (default 300).
  - `--ws-frame-max-bytes` / `GIGASTT_WS_FRAME_MAX_BYTES` — max WS frame / message (default 512 KiB).
  - `--body-limit-bytes` / `GIGASTT_BODY_LIMIT_BYTES` — max REST body (default 50 MiB).
  Delivered via a new `RuntimeLimits` field on `ServerConfig` and `http::AppState`; TOML config file support stays for a follow-up.
- **Canonical WebSocket path `/v1/ws`** (closes `specs/todo.md` item 11). Versioned path aligned with REST; legacy `/ws` remains as an alias with a warn-level deprecation log on every upgrade. Removal planned for v1.0.
- **`diarization` capability in `GET /v1/models`** (closes `specs/todo.md` item 12). Mirrors the WebSocket `Ready` field so clients can probe capabilities without opening a WS.
- **Docker `GIGASTT_BAKE_MODEL=1` build-arg** (closes `specs/todo.md` item 10). When set, a dedicated `model-fetcher` stage runs `gigastt download` during image build and the runtime stage copies the model into `/home/gigastt/.gigastt/models/`. Default (`0`) preserves the slim image.
- **`cargo deny check` in CI + `deny.toml`** (closes first half of `specs/todo.md` item 14 — SBOM stays for later). Enforces license allowlist + advisory scan + crates.io-only source + wildcard ban on every PR via `EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny-action@v2`.

### Changed

- `http::AppState` now carries `limits: RuntimeLimits` alongside `engine`; `handle_ws_inner` takes `&RuntimeLimits` so the idle timeout is no longer hard-coded.
- `DefaultBodyLimit::max` in the Axum router reads from `config.limits.body_limit_bytes` instead of the old `50 * 1024 * 1024` literal.
- `ws_handler` reads `ws_frame_max_bytes` from `AppState` instead of baking 512 KiB into the code path.

### Notes

- `RuntimeLimits`, `ServerConfig::local`, and `run_with_config` are public — downstream embedders can construct a fully customised server without CLI.
- Murmur remains on v0.6.0: no wire protocol break, new limits are additive + opt-in.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-04-17

### Changed

- **`handle_ws_inner` refactor** (`src/server/mod.rs`) — extracted three frame handlers (`handle_binary_frame`, `handle_configure_message`, `handle_stop_message`) and a `send_server_message` helper; the session loop is now ~60 lines with a single `FrameOutcome` dispatch. Behavior unchanged (same tests + clippy clean); reduces future risk when touching the hot path.

### Added

- **Integration test for origin middleware** (`src/server/mod.rs::tests::test_origin_middleware_integration`) — spins a minimal axum router with `origin_middleware` on a real port and verifies: `/health` is exempt, cross-origin `/v1/*` returns 403 `origin_denied`, loopback Origin is echoed into `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, no-Origin requests pass through, and `localhost.evil.example.com` DNS-continuation attempts are denied.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added

- **Origin allowlist middleware.** Cross-origin requests from non-loopback pages are denied by default across `/v1/*` and `/ws`; loopback origins (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `[::1]`) always pass. New CLI flags:
  - `--allow-origin <URL>` (repeatable) — exact-match, case-insensitive Origin allowlist.
  - `--cors-allow-any` — legacy `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` behaviour, opt-in.
  `/health` remains free of Origin checks for monitoring / Docker `HEALTHCHECK`.
- **`--bind-all` guard.** `gigastt serve` refuses non-loopback `--host` values (`0.0.0.0`, LAN IPs, …) unless `--bind-all` is passed or `GIGASTT_ALLOW_BIND_ANY=1` is set. Both `Dockerfile` and `Dockerfile.cuda` now pass `--bind-all` in their `CMD` line.
- **`Retry-After` on pool saturation.**
  - REST `/v1/transcribe` and `/v1/transcribe/stream` return HTTP 503 with a `Retry-After: 30` header (RFC 9110 §10.2.3) and `retry_after_ms: 30000` in the JSON body.
  - WebSocket `ServerMessage::Error` gained an optional `retry_after_ms` field (omitted from JSON when absent, preserving backward compatibility); the pool-timeout path at connect emits `retry_after_ms: 30000`.
- **`gigastt::server::{ServerConfig, OriginPolicy, run_with_config}`** — new public API for programmatic startup with explicit origin policy.

### Changed

- **Default cross-origin posture is now deny.** Previous behaviour (wildcard CORS + non-local Origin only warned about) is preserved behind `--cors-allow-any`. Browser integrations hitting the server from a non-loopback page must either add their origin via `--allow-origin` or run the server with `--cors-allow-any`.

### Security

- Closes `specs/todo.md` P1 items 4, 5, 8, 9. Reduces the risk that a malicious webpage can drive-by-connect to the local transcription server and exfiltrate microphone audio.

## [0.5.3] - 2026-04-17

### Security

- **`rustls-webpki` 0.103.10 → 0.103.12** (`Cargo.lock`) — resolves RUSTSEC-2026-0098 (name constraints for URI names incorrectly accepted) and RUSTSEC-2026-0099 (name constraints accepted for certificates asserting a wildcard name). Pulled in transitively via `reqwest → hyper-rustls → rustls`.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed

- **CI clippy** (`src/model/mod.rs:29`) — replaced manual `if self.total > 0` division guard with `checked_div`, satisfying Rust 1.95's new `clippy::manual_checked_ops` lint that broke CI on v0.5.1.
- **Release workflow** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) — removed the `linux-x86_64-cuda` matrix entry: `Jimver/cuda-toolkit@v0.2.19` cannot resolve the `cuda-nvcc-12-4` / `cuda-cudart-12-4` packages on `ubuntu-latest`. Tracked for re-enabling in `specs/todo.md`. Until then CUDA users build from source.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-04-17

### Added

- **Release automation** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) — tag-triggered matrix workflow that produces `gigastt-<ver>-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz` (coreml), `gigastt-<ver>-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz` (cpu), `gigastt-<ver>-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-cuda.tar.gz`, per-asset `.sha256` files, and aggregated `SHA256SUMS.txt`. Replaces ad-hoc manual uploads that previously broke SHA-pinned downstream clients.
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** — release checklist and contribution guidelines, including an explicit prohibition on manual `gh release upload` of binary assets.
- **`examples/bun_client.ts`, `examples/go_client.go`, `examples/KotlinClient.kt`** — WebSocket client samples in Go, Kotlin (OkHttp), and Bun-native TypeScript.
- **`specs/todo.md` + `specs/plan.md`** — 20-item follow-up list from the v0.5.0 critique, ranked P0/P1/P2 and sequenced into six phases through v1.0.0.

### Fixed

- **WebSocket pool recovery after inference panic** (`src/server/mod.rs`) — a panic inside `process_chunk` used to leak the `SessionTriplet` and permanently shrink the pool. Now the blocking task owns the state and triplet, wraps the inner call in `catch_unwind(AssertUnwindSafe(_))`, and returns both unconditionally. On panic the WS session sends an `inference_panic` error, resets its streaming state, and continues instead of tearing down.
- **`clippy::never_loop`** in `tests/e2e_errors.rs` (two occurrences) — replaced the single-iteration `while let` drains with a `tokio::time::timeout(_).await` call, unblocking stricter lint levels.

### Removed

- **`scripts/quantize.py`** — superseded by native Rust quantization (`gigastt quantize --features quantize`).
- **`examples/js_client.mjs`** — replaced by `examples/bun_client.ts`.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added

- **Native Rust INT8 quantization** (`--features quantize`) — `gigastt quantize` command replaces `scripts/quantize.py`. Per-channel symmetric QDQ format, hardened against shared weights and malformed tensors.
- **Auto-quantize on download/serve** — automatically creates INT8 encoder when built with `--features quantize`. Prints hint otherwise.
- **`GET /v1/models` endpoint** — returns model info: encoder type (int8/fp32), vocab size, pool status, supported formats and sample rates.
- **`--log-level` CLI option** — global flag for all commands (`gigastt --log-level debug serve`), replaces `RUST_LOG`-only config.
- **`--pool-size` CLI option** — configurable concurrent inference sessions for `serve` command.
- **`Engine::is_int8()`** method exposes encoder quantization status.
- **PrepackedWeights** — shared ONNX Runtime weight memory across session pool (reduced memory footprint).
- **Inference instrumentation** — encoder/decoder timing logged at info level.
- **Russian README** (`README_RU.md`) with language switcher.
- **CI `cargo fmt --check`** job for format enforcement.

### Changed

- **WER benchmark** verified on 993 Golos samples (4991 words): FP32 10.5%, INT8 10.4% — 0% degradation confirmed.
- **README** updated with verified metrics: WER 10.4%, latency ~700ms, memory ~560MB. Expanded comparison table.
- **Decoder optimization** — cached decoder output during blank runs (86% decoder call reduction).
- **Optimized model cache** directory for pre-compiled ONNX models.

### Fixed

- **Server hardening** — WS pool checkout timeout (30s), REST `catch_unwind` for panic recovery, removed `unwrap`/`expect` in handlers.
- **Security** — upgraded `tokio-tungstenite` 0.24→0.28, resolving RUSTSEC-2026-0097 (`rand` 0.8.5 unsoundness).
- **CI stability** — e2e tests serialized with `--test-threads=1` (prevents OOM), shutdown tests excluded (require graceful connection termination), SSE tests resilient to non-speech audio.
- **Benchmark overflow** — `number_to_words` handles numbers > 999,999.
- **Dockerfiles** updated to Rust 1.85+ for edition 2024 support.
- **Audio decode refactor** — extracted shared inner function, eliminated ~80 line duplication.

## [0.4.3] - 2026-04-13

### Added

- **Comprehensive e2e test infrastructure** — 28 new tests across 7 files:
  - `tests/e2e_rest.rs` (8 tests): health, transcribe, SSE streaming, error paths
  - `tests/e2e_ws.rs` (9 tests): WebSocket protocol — ready, audio, stop, configure, malformed JSON, disconnect, concurrency
  - `tests/e2e_errors.rs` (5 tests): oversized body/frame rejection, pool saturation (503), idle timeout
  - `tests/e2e_shutdown.rs` (2 tests): graceful shutdown during active WS/SSE sessions
  - `tests/load_test.rs` (3 tests): 4 concurrent WS/REST, burst 20 connections
  - `tests/soak_test.rs` (1 test): continuous WS cycling (configurable via `GIGASTT_SOAK_DURATION_SECS`)
- **Shared test helpers** (`tests/common/mod.rs`): `start_server` with clean shutdown, `wait_for_ready` with exponential backoff, WAV generation, WebSocket connect helpers.
- **`server::run_with_shutdown()`** — accepts optional `oneshot::Receiver<()>` for programmatic server shutdown (used by tests; `run()` unchanged).
- **CI feature matrix** — split into 7 jobs: clippy, unit tests, build-coreml, build-cuda, build-diarization, e2e tests (main push only with cached model), security audit.

### Changed

- CI workflow restructured: PRs get fast feedback (unit + clippy + feature builds), main push adds full e2e suite with ~850MB cached model (OS-independent cache key).

## [0.4.2] - 2026-04-13

### Removed

- **`dirs` dependency** — replaced with `env::var("HOME")` / `USERPROFILE` (~10 lines).
- **`indicatif` dependency** — replaced with simple stderr progress output (~50 transitive deps removed).
- **`tempfile` from production deps** — HTTP handlers decode audio from memory via `Cursor<Vec<u8>>` (faster, no disk I/O). Kept in dev-dependencies for tests.
- **`async-stream` dependency** — replaced with `futures_util::stream::unfold`.
- **`tower-http` dependency** — replaced with axum's built-in `DefaultBodyLimit`.

### Added

- `decode_audio_bytes()` — decode audio from in-memory bytes without temp files.
- `Engine::transcribe_bytes()` — transcribe from byte buffer directly.
- Security audit job in CI workflow (`cargo audit`).
- Non-root user in Dockerfiles (hardened containers).

## [0.4.1] - 2026-04-13

### Changed

- Diarization module no longer depends on internal `ort_err()` helper — uses `anyhow::Context` instead. Module is now self-contained and ready for future crate extraction.

### Fixed

- Centroid re-normalization after running average update (prevents speaker clustering drift).
- Semaphore timeout (30s) on HTTP endpoints prevents DoS via hanging requests.
- SSE semaphore permit held for stream lifetime (was dropped before stream consumed).
- SSE inference wrapped in `spawn_blocking` (no longer blocks async runtime).
- Error messages sanitized at HTTP API boundary (no internal path/model leakage).
- Speaker count capped at 64 (`MAX_SPEAKERS`) with graceful fallback.
- Cosine similarity zero-norm check uses epsilon (1e-8) instead of exact float equality.
- Request body dropped after temp file write (reduces peak memory ~2x for large files).
- Configure message rejected after first audio frame (`configure_too_late` error).
- WebSocket idle timeout (300s) disconnects silent clients.
- Unnecessary `samples_16k_copy` allocation skipped when diarization disabled at runtime.
- Async `tokio::fs::write` replaces blocking `std::fs::write` in HTTP handlers.
- `tokio-tungstenite` moved to dev-dependencies (unused in production code).
- `hound` dependency removed (unused).
- CLAUDE.md and README.md updated: test counts, architecture tree, WebSocket URL `/ws`, REST API docs, version references.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added

- **Cross-platform support** via compile-time Cargo feature flags:
  - `--features coreml`: macOS ARM64 (CoreML + Neural Engine) — existing behavior
  - `--features cuda`: Linux x86_64 (NVIDIA CUDA 12+)
  - Default (no features): CPU-only, compiles on any platform
  - `compile_error!` guard prevents enabling both `coreml` and `cuda`
- **Flexible sample rate**: `ClientMessage::Configure { sample_rate }` lets clients declare input rate (8kHz, 16kHz, 24kHz, 44.1kHz, 48kHz). Default 48kHz for backward compatibility.
- **Polyphase FIR resampler** (rubato `SincFixedIn`) replaces linear interpolation — significantly better audio quality.
- **`ServerMessage::Ready`** extended with `supported_rates` field (list of accepted sample rates).
- **HTTP REST API** via axum (single port serves HTTP + WebSocket):
  - `GET /health` — health check for monitoring and Docker HEALTHCHECK
  - `POST /v1/transcribe` — upload audio file, receive full JSON transcript
  - `POST /v1/transcribe/stream` — upload audio file, receive SSE stream of partial/final results
  - `GET /ws` — WebSocket streaming (existing protocol, new path)
- **Speaker diarization** (optional, `--features diarization`):
  - WeSpeaker ResNet34 ONNX model (26.5MB, 256-dim embeddings, 16kHz)
  - Online incremental clustering (cosine similarity, configurable threshold)
  - `WordInfo.speaker: Option<u32>` field identifies speakers per word
  - `Configure { diarization: true }` enables per-session
  - `gigastt download --diarization` fetches speaker model separately
  - MAX_SPEAKERS=64 cap with graceful fallback to closest match
- **`Dockerfile.cuda`** — multi-stage CUDA build with `nvidia/cuda:12.6.3-cudnn-runtime`
- **GitHub Actions CI** matrix: macOS (CoreML) + Linux (CPU) in parallel
- **Semaphore timeout** (30s) on HTTP endpoints prevents DoS via hanging requests
- **WebSocket idle timeout** (300s) disconnects silent clients
- **Configure guard** — server rejects `Configure` after first audio frame

### Changed

- **Server migrated from raw tokio-tungstenite to axum** — single port serves HTTP routes + WebSocket upgrade
- **WebSocket endpoint moved to `/ws`** (was root `/`). Clients must connect to `ws://host:port/ws`.
- **`ClientMessage::Configure.sample_rate`** changed from `u32` to `Option<u32>` to support partial configuration (sample rate only, diarization only, or both).
- **Dockerfile** CPU build no longer uses `--no-default-features` (default features are now empty = CPU).
- **SSE inference** runs in `spawn_blocking` (no longer blocks async runtime).
- **Error responses** in HTTP handlers sanitized — generic messages to clients, details logged server-side.
- `tokio-tungstenite` moved from production to dev-dependencies (only used in integration tests).
- `hound` dependency removed (unused; all audio decoding via symphonia).

### Fixed

- **Centroid drift in speaker clustering** — centroids re-normalized after running average update.
- **Cosine similarity** zero-norm check uses epsilon (1e-8) instead of exact float equality.
- **SSE semaphore permit** held for stream lifetime (was dropped before stream consumed).
- **HTTP body memory** — request body dropped after temp file write, reducing peak memory usage.
- **Async file I/O** — `tokio::fs::write` replaces blocking `std::fs::write` in HTTP handlers.

### Breaking Changes

- WebSocket path changed: `/` → `/ws`. Update client connection URLs.
- `Configure.sample_rate` type changed: `u32` → `Option<u32>`. Existing JSON `{"type":"configure","sample_rate":8000}` still works via `#[serde(default)]`.
- Default `cargo build` (no features) now produces CPU-only binary. macOS users must explicitly add `--features coreml`.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-12

### Added

- `GigasttError` enum (`error` module) with variants: `ModelLoad`, `Inference`, `InvalidAudio`, `Io` — enables `match`-based error handling.
- `#[non_exhaustive]` on all public structs and enums — future additions are non-breaking.
- Comprehensive `///` rustdoc on all public types, functions, fields, and constants.
- Crate-level documentation with quick-start examples in `lib.rs`.
- Stress tests for NaN/infinity audio samples, empty inputs, and buffer boundary conditions.

### Fixed

- Potential panic on odd-length WebSocket binary frames (`chunks_exact(2)` now drops trailing byte with warning).
- Non-finite audio samples (NaN, infinity) in `resample()` replaced with zeros instead of propagating.

### Breaking Changes

- `Engine::load()`, `Engine::process_chunk()`, and `Engine::transcribe_file()` return `Result<T, GigasttError>` instead of `anyhow::Result<T>`.
- All public structs/enums are `#[non_exhaustive]` — external struct literal construction requires constructor methods.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-06

### Added

- Partial transcripts with real-time streaming via WebSocket.
- Endpointing detection (~600ms silence triggers finalization).
- Per-word timestamps (`WordInfo.start`, `WordInfo.end`) relative to stream start.
- Per-word confidence scores (`WordInfo.confidence`) averaged over BPE tokens.
- CoreML execution provider for macOS ARM64 (Neural Engine + CPU).
- INT8 quantized encoder support (`v3_e2e_rnnt_encoder_int8.onnx`, ~4x smaller, ~43% faster).
- CoreML model cache directory (`~/.gigastt/models/coreml_cache/`).
- Docker multi-stage build (`Dockerfile`).
- Python quantization script (`scripts/quantize.py`).

### Changed

- Audio pipeline: accept 48kHz from WebSocket clients, resample to 16kHz internally.
- Encoder output shape handling: channels-first `[1, 768, T]` format.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-04-01

### Added

- GigaAM v3 e2e_rnnt inference engine with ONNX Runtime.
- WebSocket server (tokio + tungstenite) for streaming audio.
- CLI: `serve`, `download`, `transcribe` commands.
- HuggingFace model auto-download (`istupakov/gigaam-v3-onnx`).
- BPE tokenizer (1025 tokens).
- Mel spectrogram (64 bins, FFT=320, hop=160, HTK).
- RNN-T greedy decode loop.
- Multi-format audio support: WAV, MP3, M4A/AAC, OGG/Vorbis, FLAC (via symphonia).
- 39 unit tests (tokenizer, features, decode, inference, protocol).
